Spectroscopic monitoring (Tokovinin, in preparation) shows that all three components are similar stars of approximately one solar mass. Here we resolved the outer subsystem AB and observed its fast motion. In fact it was already resolved at SOAR on 2011.036 at 221.0deg and 0"".044, but this low-quality observation has not been published.

A previous orbit was VlF2007 calculated by Cvetkovic (2008) with period of 109 years and semimajor Cve2008c axis of 0.344 arcsec. However, our new observation shows that the system has a much shorter period and smaller semimajor axis. However, our orbit yields roughly the same total mass, with large uncertainty. The system appears to have executed nearly a full orbit since the first speckle observations taken of it in 1985 by McAlister et al. (1987). More data will be needed to confirm this orbital trajectory, but if correct, the smaller period makes the system much more attractive for future study. Hor2015b"

The eclipse phenomena, known since historical times (although the time of minimum brightness was first measured by Montanari on 8 Nov 1670) was first explained as an eclipsing binary by Goodericke as early as 1782. According to R.G. Aitken, this was verified when it was noted as A__1935f the second spectroscopic binary based on photographic spectra obtained by Prof. H.C. Vogel at Potsdam in November, 1889. Belopolsky discovered a variation in the radial velocity with a period of order 1.8 years, later resolved by Labeyrie and his speckle camera in 1973; Lab1974 the magnitude difference is about 2.5. The binary, a radio and X-ray source, is triple (and possibly quadruple, but the variation with the 32 yr period is more probably an apsidal rotation of the eclipsing pair). The spectroscopic data were discussed by Hill et al. (1970, 1971). HlG1970 ADS lists several distant, faint, and probably optical companions. HlG1971 Elements P, T, e, and omega for Labeyrie et al.

Astron. Inst. Czech. 31, CHR 209 321). The discovery of speckle companion CHR 209 Ea,Eb with a period WSI 20 of some 60 y confirms the third body model advocated by Mayer et al. HZG 2 (1994 A&A 288, L13) based on the appearance of the spectrum and HLM 3 variations in the time of light curve minimum (they suggest a third body period of 50.7 y). Another light curve solution is given by Harries et al. (1998 MNRAS 295, 386). The B component was also observed and appeared to be single. Classification of the B component is from the WDS. Msn1998a This complex multiple system has had numerous identification errors due to various difficulties. The diagram of Lewis in his catalog of L__1906b the Struve pairs, which seemed a good first step, was hampered by the quadrant error of the pair he designated Ca. This quadrant error was repeated in the ADS, IDS, and in earlier editions of the WDS. In the ADS (where this pair is listed as #2984, but note that #2989 is part of this system, too) the errors multiplied. The pair Holmes AF (WDS designation HLM 3AF) is apparently the same as STF 485Ac. Inspection of scanned images of this region of the sky have allowed the Hertzsprung pairs (HZG 2) whose components are given within quotation marks in the ADS to be identified. Of the HZG pairs, the ""CD"" pairing is the same as STF 484AC and the ""CE"" pairing is the same as STF 484AB. The ADS note to the ""AJ"" pairing of HZG 2 is a typographical error. The correct position angle is 77 degrees, which corresponds to the AD (now AO) pair. Below outlines the changes from the WDS 2001.0 to the current version.

The Gorda et al. (2007) orbit Grd2007a is based on changes in the period of SZ Cam to determine P, omega, e, Grd2007b and T, and speckle measures to derive i, Omega, and a. They derive a distance of 1125 +/- 135 pc, which exceeds by 30% the 800pc distance to the open cluster NGC 1502; they conclude that SZ Cam is not a member of the cluster. The mass of the eclipsing pair (Ea) is 28.5 +/- 0.5 Msun, that of the third body (Eb) 23.4 +/- 2.4 Msun. Eb is also a close binary. STF 484 GH: STI 492."

The estimated masses of Ba and Bb, 0.98 and 0.65 Msun, Nrd2004 respectively, remove the discrepancy between the mass sum of 3.05 Msun calculated for the AB system from its grade 4 orbit by Hartkopf et al. Hrt2008 (2008) and the expected mass sum. Although such discrepancies are not uncommon for low-quality orbits, in this case it serves as an indirect confirmation of Ba,Bb. Estimated period of Ba,Bb is ~20 yr. Rbr2015d"

CLO 10 Aa,Ab: Close et al. discovered a companion to the A component at a Clo2005 separation of 0"".156, which they refer to as the A and C components (the companion was labelled as C when detected as an astrometric reflex motion of AB Dor in observations by VLBI and Hipparcos). Based on the astrometric orbit and the AO resolution, the mass of the Ab companion is estimated at 0.090 +/- 0.005 Msun, just above the mass of a brown dwarf. AO spectroscopy yields a spectral type of M8 +/- 1. Mass of Aa & Ab = 0.90(0.08) & 0.090(0.008) \msun. Model comparison Azu2017 gives age of Aa & Ab = 40-50 Myr & 25-120 Myr.

E component = A component of 05369-4758 = D component of 06225-6013. CLO 10 Ba,Bb: Close et al. also resolved the B component into a 66mas pair. Clo2005 Spectral types of Ba and Bb are estimated by Janson et al. at M5 and Jnn2007 M5-6, masses at 0.13-0.2 and 0.11-0.18 Msun. Aa is a rapidly-rotating spotted star (0.09 mag variability in V). Boc2008 Close et al. (2007) find spectral types for Aa, Ab, Ba, and Bb of K1, Clo2007b M5.5 +/- 1.0, M3.5 +/- 1.5, M4.5 +/- 1.5. Masses are 0.865 +/- 0.034, 0.090 +/- 0.005, <0.25, <0.15 Msun; the system age is 75 +/- 25 Myr and the distance 14.9 +/- 0.1 pc. Ba,Bb: Wolter et al. (2014) made a multiwavelength study of AB Dor Ba,Bb. They derive effective temperatures 3260-3360 and 3200-3300K for Ba and Bb, respectively. Predicted system mass is 0.45-0.71 Msun, age 50-100 Myr. (Ed note: Inclination for Wolter et al orbit (182deg) WoU2014 appears to be off by 90deg; changed to 92deg in orbit catalog) Ba,Bb: Azulay et al. (2015) derive an orbit for AB Dor B, yielding a parallax of 66.4 +/- 0.5 mas, as well as component masses for Ba and Bb of 0.28 +/- 0.05 and 0.25 +/- 0.05 Msun. Azu2015"

Bessel, in 1834, notes that the proper motion was variable and, in his letter to Humboldt, stated that ""..Procyon and Sirius are genuine binary systems, each consisting of a visible and an invisible star."" Not quite invisible, this large dm pair consisting of a main sequence A star and a white dwarf was first resolved by Alvan G. Clark on 31 January 1862 in the process of of testing the 18.5"" refractor. See notes by Burnham and Aitken. Bu_1906 The separation for the 1862.275 measurement by Lassell is reported as Lsl1862 4.92"". This is clearly incorrect and not consistent with measurements by other observers. WDS catalogers assume an factor of 2 error and correct separation to 9.84"". Otto Struve lists a measurement of Sirius in 1861.21. However, this Stt1893a predates the discovery of the companion Sirius B by A. Clark and his son on 1962 Jan 31 and the first formal measurement by G. P. Bond on 1862 February 7. Comparing the uncorrected PA and separation in Struve's table in 1893 with the measurements published by Struve, we Stt1864 suspect that 1861.21 is a typo and should refer to the observation on 1863-Mar-16. Companion almost hidden behind secondary mirror diffraction ray from Sirius B was never observed at these position angles until the early Sea1882 20th century. We suspect that this is a clerical error and that the measurements pertain to another system. For the 1882.988 measurement the PA is listed as 41.6 deg and is Bu_1883 40.6 in another. Bu_1883b Many of the recovery observations of Sirius B following the periastron passage after 1890 are doubtful. The recovery observations made by See1896d See, Douglass, and Cogshall at Lowell Observatory from 1896.668 to Dgl1896 1896.695 were taken in the morning shortly before sunrise when Sirius Cog1896a was low in the sky. See notes that the mean position angle of 220 deg at 5.10"" is about 30 deg behind its predicted location and the sep sep is larger than expected based on previous orbit fit. Aitken and A__1896d Schaeberle reported measurements between 1896.814-1897.027 made from Shb1897a Lick Observatory at a significantly different mean position angle of 189 deg and 3.7"". Both Aitken and Schaeberle comment that neither of them saw a star at the position reported by Dr. See. Following the contradictory reports, Stimson J. Brown published observations from Brs1896 his logbook that were taken earlier in March 1896 at the USNO. The position angle is similar to the values reported by Aitken, but the separation is about 1"" larger. Brown notes that the observations were taken under challenging conditions and he did not have much confidence in their reliability. See later refuted his earlier measurements See1897e after unsuccessfully searching for the companion while observing from Mexico and then successfully detecting the companion at a pa of 175 deg and 4.6"" in September 1897 at Lowell. He writes, ""The erroneous conclusion to which I was led last year seems to have arisen from a very unusual and entirely unexpected cause, of which we need not speak here..."" In hindsight, See also reported in that publication, two observations from April 1895 that he initially did not think were worthy of announcing. The difficulty in attempting to find Sirius B using the Lick Observatory 36 inch in February and March of 1896 was described by William J. Hussey. Hu_1896 See1900d and Brs1900b measures : ""All of the observations have been See1900d thoroughly checked. A number of errors were discovered in the earlier Brs1900b reductions and corrected. These reductions have also been slighty See1911 changed by the adoption of a later and better determined value of a Brs1911a revolution of the micrometer screw. This will account for small discrepanacies between the results published here and those previously published in the astronomical periodicals."" For the 1904.186 measuremment by T. Lewis, the title of the article, L__1904 text, and first page of the data table all refer to observations taken in 1904. Subsequent pages of the data table (including the page that Sirius is listed on) list an epoch of 1903. However, this is probably a typo, so date corrected the date to be in 1904. Sirius A. B__1959a Hipparcos astrometric solution adopted some elements from the orbit of HIP1997d Gatewood & Gatewood (1978). Gat1978 AB: Malkov et al. (2012) derive dynamical, photometric, and spectroscopic masses 3.08 +/- 0.42, 2.46, and 2.19 Msun, respectively. Mlk2012 BC: Suspected by Fox in 1920, also reported by Innes, van den Bos, and A__1932a Finsen. Other observers fail to confirm duplicity of B. Single 1945, B__1929a 1946, 1949, 1950. Recovered by Popovic in 1975 at approximately the Fin1929a the same position as the 1929 resolutions. If these are periodic, the Pop1977b next approximate time for resolution is 2020. Therefore, since we believe the detections of C to be real, but likely of a background optical interloper, BC carries a ""U"" code and not an ""X"" code. However, very compelling argument that this is a chance allignment of Lec2000 a non-physical background star appearing close to Sirius AB is the 1920-30 time period is now assumed. Time displacement residuals over a period of 6.8y are linear ruling Ldb1973 out a 6.4y perturbation with an amplitude of 0.14"". There is no evidence of a close companion with this nature associated with Sirius. Otto Struve corrected his measurements for systematic errors by Stt1893a measuring artificial double stars. He provided both the original and corrected measures of the separation and position angle for the companion of Sirius. Aitken cautions that the variance of the angles A__1935f and distances compared with other observers is often larger for Struve's corrected values. However in the case of Struve's measurements of the companion of Sirius, Bond et al. mean residuals in the position BdH2017 angle improved when using the corrected values, while the residuals in separation did not change significantly, so the corrected values are reported here. For the photographic observations by Lindenblad, tables are given for Ldb1970 the raw individual measures, while only the mean measures are corrected Ldb1973 for emulsion contraction. The average time span covered by these mean measures is ~ 70 nights, so we used Lindenblad's tabulated scale BdH2017 corrections to compute corrected separations and position angles for the individual measurements. We then took the mean for plates taken on the same night, reducing the number of individual measurements from 157 down to 77 measurements on unique dates. X coded van Albada (1962) measures corrected for emulsion contraction. vAb1971 Jasinta & Hidayat (1999) did not correct these epochs for emulsion Jas1999b contraction. Measure of Anton corrected in a later publication. Ant2010 Ant2012 Schroeder measure re-reducted and corrected in Bond Table 2.

All B__1961a speckle observations show no trace of the subsystem AB, except the one on 1989.305 where B looks doubtful and much fainter than C (McAlister McA1990 1990). No trace of B was seen at SOAR in 2008-2011 (4 speckle runs). AC follows a Keplerian orbit with 81 yr period (Hartkopf et al. 2012) Hrt2012a which was slightly corrected here using the latest measure. This excludes confusion between the companions (i.e. B and C being the same star). Besides, both were measured concurrently by van den Bos. The companion B cannot be real. The closest separation of AC is 0.09"" according to the orbit and excludes any sub-system with comparable separation because such a triple star would be dynamically unstable. The fact that the orbit of AC is known does not allow us to explain the apparent non-hierarchical configuration by projection. If B were real, its orbital period would be on the order of 10 yr (scaling from the orbit of AC) and it would have shown up in our speckle data. Like 104 Tau, we have here a binary which actually is not binary, but a ghost. Tok2012b AB,C: Malkov et al.

The close pair of Tango et al. (1979), originally thought to be a new Tng1979 close pair (and called TNG 1), was determined to be the Innes pair with a reflection around the E/W axis.

The Mark III data were taken with baselines of 28.0 and 31.5 meters, using 500, 550, and 800nm filters. NPOI data were taken using three baselines from 19 to 38 meters and in 20 channels from 530 to 850nm.

Trr2006a The Hipparcos parallax corrected for binary motion is 20.6+/-1.9mas. The spectroscopic secondary companion is over-massive, most likely a close pair of M-dwarfs. If so, the new speckle companion at 1"".66 with a period on the order of 500yr makes the system quadruple. The speckle companion might contribute to the IR excess found by Torres.

However, the C component designation is already in use for Innes' 30"" companion. Also, their B designation redefines B from the photocenter of the previously unresolved close stellar pair to one component of that pair. We have therefore designated the two stars as Ba and Bb, in keeping with our usual hierarchical designation scheme.

Star B is W UMa-type eclipsing SB2; P = 0.2678 d (Popper 1943; Ppp1943 Binnendijk 1955, AJ 60, 355). The RV of pair B differs by +30 km/s from that of star A, much more than the visual motion can effect, and thus does not represent the true mass-center velocity of B. The eclipsing period undergoes intrinsic changes considerably larger than a lighttime effect in the orbit AB. Attempts to identify the ascending node are thus unreliable: Time shifts of light minima suggest the first quadrant (Plaut), the RV difference the third quadrant (Heintz). The close approach in the visual orbit in recent years has prevented continued study of the eclipsing system. See Baize & Petit (1989) catalog of doubles with variable component.

The timing of periastron passage has been revised to UT 2011 Jul 6 +/- 2d. Expected minimum separation at closest approach is predicted to be 6.14 +/- 0.07 mas (14 stellar radii). Malkov et al.

Total mass 28 +/- 11 Msun, with the large error bar resulting from uncertainty in parallax estimate. Individual masses estimated at 13.9 (from photometry and spectroscopy) and ~6 Msun (based on mass ratio from RV measurements during periastron). CIA2012c The disk dissipates near apastron and then begins reforming as the XXX2020d companion approaches periastron. The V magnitude is variable over the orbit but it is unclear if this is due to the secondary or interaction between the primary and the disk."

(2009) monitored the RV of both the A and B components every 1-2 months between 2003 Mar - 2007 Nov, using a high-dispersion echelle (precision ~10 m/s). The A component exhibits a linear trend in RV, with a slope +220 m/s/y. Toyota et al. assert that these variations are due to an unseen companion. Assuming a circular orbit, period is estimated at 3200d; minimum mass of the unseen star ~50 Mjup. Standard deviation of radial velocities for the B component <40 m/s and velocities show no periodic variation.

Our standard algorithm, fitstars, produced subpar results on this star and instead we used the deconvolution technique used in Riddle et al. (2015) to analyze this star. It is resolved here at 0"".07. The magnitude difference of Aa,Ab (dK = 2.43) matches the spectroscopic mass ratio of 0.52 and corresponds to the Ab mass of 0.60 Msun.

The new data suggest that nearly half an orbit has been completed since the first speckle observation. The primary is probably close to an A0V star, and with a magnitude difference of perhaps 2-2.5, we estimate that the secondary is an F2V star. This would suggest a mass sum in the range 4-5 Msun, which is lower than what is implied by the value of P and a we derive, together with the Hipparcos parallax of 5.04 +/- 0.39 mas. We expect that the next decade will provide an opportunity to improve upon the orbit presented here since the separation will be above 0.1 arcsec and the position angle is expected to cover about 30deg. We encourage other observers to put this object back on their observing lists for the next few years. Hor2015b"

Tok1991 An astrometric orbit was deduced from Hipparcos data by Jancart et al. Jnc2005 (2005). The period derived for the visual orbit matches both the spectroscopic and astrometric solutions within the uncertainty, and other orbital parametrs are in reasonable agreement with the Tokovinin solution. The updated Hipparcos parallax (39.98 +/- 0.73 mas), combined with the orbit, yields a mass sum of 2.0 +/- 0.3 Msun. The composite spectral type is K3V; a magnitude difference of 0.8 mags makes the component spectral types roughly K1V + K4V, which suggests a mass sum of 1.2-1.5 Msun, accounting for the lower metallicity.

We are currently McA1993 undertaking a duplicity survey of all bright (V<8) galactic O stars; this is one of four new binaries found by us so far in this survey. McA1987a This system is also a known spectroscopic binary, and we are reanalyzing archival radial velocity data in an attempt to derive masses via a combined interferometric/spectroscopic orbit (see Gies et Gie1993 al. 1993 for a similar combined solution of the O star 15 Mon). The estimated period of the speckle binary orbit (CHR 96 Aa) is 31 y. The orbit quality rating in Table 1 is our own. The system is currently unresolved with the Mt. Wilson Hooker telescope, but we continue to observe this target. The brighter star of the speckle pair is also a 311-day, single-lined spectroscopic binary (McKibben et Bgn1998 al. 1998). The classifications of the C and D components are from Hof1991 Hoffleit & Warren (1991). Msn1998a Cluster/Main-Sequence fitting determines a cluster distance of Rbr2010b 741 +/- 36 pc.

The discrepant PM of B reported in the WDS could be caused by the subsystem Ba,Bb discovered here. The A component has an astrometric subsystem Aa,Ab with P = 3.9 yr (Goldin & Makarov 2007), confirmed spectroscopically by D. Latham. The B Gln2007 component was tentatively resolved by Robo-AO, but was thought to be too uncertain to publish in Riddle et al. (2015). Now Ba,Bb is RAO2015 clearly resolved at 0"".17. Its estimated period is ~30 yr. The field is extremely crowded and another faint star E is detected at 12"".1 from A by both Robo-AO and PALM-3000.

(2009 A&A 504, 829), the target is young, so its companion could indeed be a PMS star. The object was already targeted by Metchev & Hillenbrand (2009) in their survey of Met2009 young stars, but the binary was not detected. After learning of our discovery, Metchev was able to extract a measurement of the star from the archival data (S. Metchev 2015, private communication). Rbr2015d"

Spectral types and masses of components assigned by ten Brummelaar et al., based on adaptive optics observations. TtB2000 This is an example of a system whose earlier long period, low- eccentricity orbit has been supplanted by a high-eccentricity orbit of half P due to correct quadrant determination. The motion causes double spectral lines over part of the orbit, but the components are indistinguishable in the spectrum as well as visually. The RV curve gives the elements T, e, and the longitude of periastron somewhat in variance with those of the visual orbit; cf. Dworetsky et al. (1971). Dwo1971 Pourbaix gives combined solution for this resolved SB2, yielding Pbx2000b orbital parallaxes and component masses. Arenou (2000) gives combined solution of astrometric orbits and DSBs.

For the visual pair West (1976) computed the elements P, T, e, and Wst1976 longitude of periastron also from the RV's (orbit 3); tentative elements a, i, and the node were added by Heintz in order to have a complete listing in the Fourth Orbit Catalog. Since the components are visually indistinguishable, the quadrant of the ascending node (but not the longitude of periastron) is arbitrary; with the node chosen as listed, the close pair would be the eastern component when the visual pair is at maximum separation. The pair was long assumed to have a 12 yr period. 1980.4853 This measure was incorrectly identified with HR 8131 = alp Equ in McAlister et al. (1983).

The reason for this is that the A component was the AstraLux target, and the BC pair at ~7.8"" is outside of the completeness cut-off at 6"". Since the BC pair is visible in the AstraLux images, we can nonetheless analyze it astrometrically. This pair was first reported by Beuzit et al. (2004) with rho = 0.978"" and theta = 305.8deg. There are no error bars quoted, but if we assume that the quoted precision in decimal places corresponds to measurement precision, and adopt errors of 5 mas and 0.5deg, which should be conservative in that circumstance, we find that common proper motion can be confirmed at a 76 sigma confidence level. Hence, physical companionship can be confidently inferred, even if the errors should be substantially larger than what we have assumed. Jnn2012"

The mass implied by the spectral type is perhaps 2-2.5 Msun, if the system were to have solar metallicity, again lower than that implied by the orbital elements. The metallicity of the system is -0.31 according to the Geneva-Copenhagen Catalog (Nordstrom et al. 2004), which would tend to lower the mass at a given Nrd2004 spectral type, thus making the discrepancy worse. Nonetheless, given the large uncertainty in dynamical mass, it is no worse than a 2 sigma difference at this point. The mass ratio in the Geneva-Copenhagen catalog is 0.9, so this at least is consistent with the small magnitude difference obtained from speckle measures.
