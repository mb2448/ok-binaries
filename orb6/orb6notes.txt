                         A second candidate companion at 39" is noted in UCAC2 as having much            
                         different proper motion, so has been ruled out as a companion. The              
                         measured proper motion of the companion between the two SofI observing          
                         epochs is (+368 +/- 68 mas, -48 +/- 68 mas). IR spectroscopy suggests           
                         a spectral type of M4-M5V for the B component.                          Mug2007b

01379-8259   TOK 426     HIP 7601 is a nearby (27pc) dwarf also known as GJ 67.1 or HR 512.              
                         According to Wichman et al. (2003 A&A, 400, 293), it is a young                 
                         spectroscopic triple detected in X-rays (1RXS J013755.4-825838). GCS            
                         also recognized the star as SB2. Spectroscopic monitoring (Tokovinin,           
                         in preparation) shows that all three components are similar stars of            
                         approximately one solar mass. Here we resolved the outer subsystem AB           
                         and observed its fast motion. In fact it was already resolved at SOAR           
                         on 2011.036 at 221.0deg and 0".044, but this low-quality observation            
                         has not been published. The available data indicate that the period             
                         of AB is 1.35years; the pair completed nearly two revolutions since             
                         its first resolution in 2011.                                           Tok2015c

01437+5014   CIA   6     Phi Per. Be+sdO binary, resolved by the CHARA Array. The hot subdwarf           
                         companion is detected in near-IR; flux contribution 1.5% in H (dH=4.6)          
                         and restricted fits indicate flux contribution rises to 3.3% (dV~3.7)           
                         in visible.  Combined interferometric/spectroscopic orbital solution            
                         yields masses 9.6+/-0.3 and 1.2+/-0.2 Msun for the Be primary and               
                         subdwarf secondary, respectvely. The inferred distance (186+/-3pc),             
                         kinematical properties, and evolutionary state are consistent with

02182+3920   A   207     Scardia et al. (2001) orbit preliminary as all the orbital elements     Sca2001d
                         are still rather uncertain. Hipparcos parallax (0".01200 +/- 0.00311)           
                         seems to be overestimated and leads to a mass sum 0f 0.46 Msun,                 
                         unacceptable for a system of type F5. Scardia (1982) classified the     Sca1982a
                         star as type F9. Dynamical parallax is 0".0065; the corresponding mass          
                         sum is 2.87 Msun.

             EGG   2     Aa,Ab: This system has spectral type F2 from SIMBAD and parallax of             
                         10.26 +/- 2.92 mas from van Leeuwen (2007). A previous orbit was        VlF2007 
                         calculated by Cvetkovic (2008) with period of 109 years and semimajor   Cve2008c
                         axis of 0.344 arcsec. However, our new observation shows that the               
                         system has a much shorter period and smaller semimajor axis. However,           
                         our orbit yields roughly the same total mass, with large uncertainty.           
                         The system appears to have executed nearly a full orbit since the               
                         first speckle observations taken of it in 1985 by McAlister et al.              
                         (1987). More data will be needed to confirm this orbital trajectory,            
                         but if correct, the smaller period makes the system much more                   
                         attractive for future study.                                            Hor2015b

02490-1029   BRG  16     The system is precisely at the 3 sigma threshold for statistically              
                         significant exclusion of the background star hypothesis. By chance,             
                         the AB astrometry is just below the criterion (2.7 sigma) and BC is             
                         just above (3.1 sigma), so in principle the BC pair is inconsistent             
                         with chance alignment, if the pair does share a common proper motion            
                         with  A. However, the proper motion of the system has of course been            
                         determined based on A, so until the AB physical connection has been             
                         demonstrated to the required accuracy, the 3.1 sigma confidence of the          
                         BC pair is irrelevant. Hence, we label the entire system as

                         uncertainty was then 55%, is now much better defined. The dynamical

                         the AB pair is physically bound. The brightness and color are fully             
                         consistent with B being an M3.5 companion to the M2.0 primary.                  
                         Furthermore, the separation is only 0.2", and the whole field is                
                         otherwise empty. This indicates physical companionship. However, the            
                         deviation from the expectation of a background source is only 1.1               
                         sigma, and the companion has moved 3.6 times closer to the background           
                         expectation than its original position where the motion has a 14 sigma          
                         confidence. This, by contrast, suggests a chance alignment. Since the           
                         magnitude of motion is not inconsistent with what could be expected             
                         for orbital motion of a real physical pair, we keep it as binary in             
                         our analysis, but we note that further observations will be necessary           
                         in order to resolve this issue satisfactorily.                          Jnn2012

                         1.8 years, later resolved by Labeyrie and his speckle camera in 1973;   Lab1974 
                         the magnitude difference is about 2.5.                                          
                         The binary, a radio and X-ray source, is triple (and possibly                   
                         quadruple, but the variation with the 32 yr period is more probably an          
                         apsidal rotation of the eclipsing pair).

                         AB: known binary, which shows apparently a non-Keplerian motion. Rica           
                         Romero & Zirm (2014) proposed that the motion was caused by an unseen   FMR2014c
                         companion and calculated an astrometric orbit for it with P = 107 yr,           
                         eccentricity 0.61, and photocenter semimajor axis 0".179. Our                   
                         observations were able to resolve the predicted subsystem Aa,Ab. For            
                         the time of our observations the orbit predicts a companion position            
                         angle of 43.3 deg, in excellent agreement with the position angle of            
                         44 +/- 1.3 deg measured here. The ratio of the predicted displacement           
                         to the measured separation of 0".50 is r = 0.32 = q/(1+q). Hence, the           
                         mass ratio q = 0.47 (the contribution of the light from Ab to the               
                         photo-center is neglected). The mass of Aa is estimated at 1.16 Msun            
                         from its absolute magnitude, leading to 0.54 Msun for Ab. The absolute          
                         magnitude of Ab corresponds to a smaller mass of 0.33 Msun. This                
                         discrepancy, if confirmed, can be explained by Ab being a close pair

                         of the fit and the fact that the two epochs of observation are only

                         repeated in the ADS, IDS, and in earlier editions of the WDS. In the

             CHR 209     Ea,Eb: The primary of this pair is the Beta Lyrae-type O9/B0 eclipsing          
                         system SZ Cam, with a period of 2.698d. The Gorda et al. (2007) orbit   Grd2007a
                         is based on changes in the period of SZ Cam to determine P, omega, e,   Grd2007b
                         and T, and speckle measures to derive i, Omega, and a. They derive a            
                         distance of 1125 +/- 135 pc, which exceeds by 30% the 800pc distance            
                         to the open cluster NGC 1502; they conclude that SZ Cam is not a                
                         member of the cluster. The mass of the eclipsing pair (Ea) is 28.5              
                         +/- 0.5 Msun, that of the third body (Eb) 23.4 +/- 2.4 Msun.                    
                         Eb is also a close binary.

                         residuals indicate the presence of a more distant Bc companion. Based

                         derived an orbit for Bab,Bc with period 9.447 +/- 0.017 yr. Mass for            
                         the A component is determined to be 2.60 +/- 0.5 Msun. Inclination              
                         angle for the Ba,Bb orbit is 53.5 +/- 0.5deg, yielding masses 1.19 and          
                         1.02 Msun for Ba and Bb. Bc appears to be over-massive; based on                
                         infrared excess this could be well explained as an equal-mass binary

                         uncertain veracity, has been included. While its status is not                  
                         definitive, subsequent confirmation or suspected duplicity (by another          
                         technique) makes the discovery measurement somewhat more probable.              
                         1991.8995: This is a particularly unexpected result, given the four             
                         previous epochs at which our observations have shown no indications of          
                         duplicity.  All four of the earlier observations were reanalyzed using          
                         the same procedures employed here, but no additional supporting                 
                         evidence of duplicity was found.  If this additional component is

                         This resolved spectroscopic binary (with P = 6.28 yr) is discussed by   McA1988

                         The published measure for 1988.6582 (McAlister et al. 1990) is          McA1990 
                         is spurious. The data leading to this measure are actually the same as          
                         those for HR 1331 (= McA 14) for the same epoch. These two stars were           
                         observed in immediate sequence but with different microscope                    
                         objectives, and the final reductions calculated two results from the            
                         same data set, but with different scale factors; the HR 1331 measure            
                         for 1988.6582 is the correct one.  Reanalysis of the correct data for

04478+3643   GAA   2     AW Per. This Cepheid is an SB with an orbital period of ~40 yr. First           
                         discovered by Miller & Preston (1964 PASP 76, 47), it took several              
                         years to derive the first orbit from radial velocity data (Evans 1989           
                         AJ 97, 1737). It is likely that this companion is itself a binary, as           
                         argued by Evans and by Evans et al. (2000 AJ 120, 407), because the             
                         magnitude difference between the Cepheid and its companion is not               
                         consistent with equal masses and predictions from evolutionary tracks.          
                         Unfortunately, Gallenne et al. (2015) note they did not have enough             
                         angular resolution and sensitivity to detect this third companion. The          
                         properties of the brightest companion were studied based on IUE                 
                         spectra by Evans (1994 ApJ 436, 273; 1995 ApJ 445, 393), who found its          
                         spectral type to be B8.3V. This is in agreement with their detection            
                         with a flux ratio f = 1.22 +/- 0.30%, i.e., a spectral type in the              
                         range B6-B9V (using d = 853 pc from a P-L relation and K = 4.63 mag     .   
                         for the Cepheid). They estimate the companion mH = 9.6 +/- 0.3 mag      .     
                         (using for the Cepheid at theirgiven phase mH = 4.84 +/- 0.01 mag from  .     
                         Monson & Pierce (2011 ApJS 193, 12). Massa & Evans (2008 MNRAS 383,             
                         139) also determined the angular separation of the component for                
                         another epoch, which will allow an estimate all the orbital elements,           
                         (see also Gallenne et al. 2013 EAS Pub. Ser. 64, 197). Gallenne et al.          
                         (2015) derived a maximum sensitivity limit at 3sigma of 0.62%, i.e.,            
                         dmH> 5.5 mag, so can therefore exclude any additional components with   .

                         by R.H. Wilson in 1934-1971, by W. Finsen (1953-1955) and by others,    WRH1941a
                         although in other instances those observers found it to be single.      Fin1953d
                         The measures suggest a near-circular orbit seen face-on with a semi-            
                         major axis on the order of 0.1" or 1.5 au. Assuming a mass sum of 2             
                         Msun, the orbital period should be around 1.3 yr; in fact, two orbits           
                         with periods 1.19 yr and 2.38 yr were published by Eggen (1956). This   Egg1956 
                         binary should be an easy target for speckle interferometry at 4-m               
                         telescopes. It was observed 10 times from 1976.9 to 1980.7 with                 
                         speckle and, surprisingly, found unresolved on all occasions,                   
                         excluding any short-period orbits. Later, however, two measures were            
                         made by the author at a 1-m telescope with a phase-grating                      
                         interferometer. The first resolution in 1984.8 at 0.04" was tentative   Tok1985 
                         (below the diffraction limit), but the second in 1985.7 was secure,     Tok1988 
                         being an average of two observations. It was followed by the speckle            
                         resolution at 4-m telescope in 1988.17, after which the pair            Mca1993 
                         disappeared again. It was found unresolved in 2012.                     Tok2012b
                         The star is well studied. Two statistical surveys of binaries within            
                         25 pc consider it to be single (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991; Raghavan et     Duq1991 
                         al. 2010). Heintz & Borgman (1984) state that measures cannot be        Rag2010 
                         fitted by any orbit and conclude: "Although this alleged visual binary  Hei1984i
                         (ADS 3701) has three published orbits, it is probably spurious".                
                         Several independent RV studies have shown that this star is not a               
                         spectroscopic binary. Precise RVs measured by Nidever et al. (2002)     Nid2002 
                         are stable to better than 100 m s-1 over 388 days, excluding orbital            
                         periods from one to two years with high confidence. Data with lower             
                         precision show a constant RV of +21 km/s over many years (Duquennoy &           
                         Mayor 1991; Abt & Willmarth 2006; Raghavan et al. 2010). The star is    AbH2006 
                         located about 1m above the main sequence, supporting the thesis of an           
                         equal-component binary. If the orbit is seen face-on, the RV variation          
                         would be small, especially if the components are of equal brightness            
                         (blended lines move in opposite directions, the centroid stays                  
                         constant). However, the lines in this star remain narrow and the                
                         speckle non-resolution during 3.8 yr firmly excludes a face-on orbit.           
                         Remember that 104 Tau is bright (no identification errors possible)             
                         and that the components are supposedly equally bright, hence easy to            
                         resolve by speckle. If this star is single (as everything seems to              
                         suggest), we cannot dismiss its multiple resolutions with micrometer,           
                         eyepiece interferometer, and speckle as spurious; occasional image              
                         doubling (or at least elongation) must be real.                         Tok2012b

                         2004). The estimated masses of Ba and Bb, 0.98 and 0.65 Msun,           Nrd2004 
                         respectively, remove the discrepancy between the mass sum of 3.05 Msun          
                         calculated for the AB system from its grade 4 orbit by Hartkopf et al.  Hrt2008 
                         (2008) and the expected mass sum. Although such discrepancies are not           
                         uncommon for low-quality orbits, in this case it serves as an indirect          
                         confirmation of Ba,Bb. Estimated period of Ba,Bb is ~20 yr.             Rbr2015d

                         this complicated multiple. Components K, J, M, O, and Q were actually

                         actually were of JI, while one other was of DH. It is believed (but             
                         not guaranteed!) that components are now identified consistently.

                         at this stage regarded as certain, while D was strongly suspected. The

                         difficulties. It is possible that the nova was simply double at that            
                         time and that the triple or quadruple chacter developed later. An               
                         alternate explanation is that the observers were able to see more

06405-0331   FAB   6     The astrometry catalogues are partly confused because the position for          
                         the star east has been linked with the star NE to produce a spurious            
                         large proper motion in Tycho-2. Curiously, AC2000 misses the star NE,           
                         which has caused the problem.

                         1862 February 7. Comparing the uncorrected PA and separation in                 
                         Struve's table in 1893 with the measurements published by Struve, we    Stt1864 
                         suspect that 1861.21 is a typo and should refer to the observation on           
                         1863-Mar-16.                                                                    
                         Companion almost hidden behind secondary mirror diffraction ray from            
                         Sirius B was never observed at these position angles until the early    Sea1882 
                         20th century. We suspect that this is a clerical error and that the             
                         measurements pertain to another system.                                         
                         For the 1882.988 measurement the PA is listed as 41.6 deg and is        Bu_1883 
                         40.6 in another.                                                        Bu_1883b
                         Many of the recovery observations of Sirius B following the periastron          
                         passage after 1890 are doubtful. The recovery observations made by      See1896d
                         See, Douglass, and Cogshall at Lowell Observatory from 1896.668 to      Dgl1896 
                         1896.695 were taken in the morning shortly before sunrise when Sirius   Cog1896a
                         was low in the sky. See notes that the mean position angle of 220 deg           
                         at 5.10" is about 30 deg behind its predicted location and the sep              
                         sep is larger than expected based on previous orbit fit. Aitken and     A__1896d
                         Schaeberle reported measurements between 1896.814-1897.027 made from    Shb1897a
                         Lick Observatory at a significantly different mean position angle of            
                         189 deg and 3.7". Both Aitken and Schaeberle comment that neither of            
                         them saw a star at the position reported by Dr. See. Following the              
                         contradictory reports, Stimson J. Brown  published observations from    Brs1896 
                         his logbook that were taken earlier in March 1896 at the USNO. The              
                         position angle is similar to the values reported by Aitken, but the             
                         separation is about 1" larger. Brown notes that the observations were           
                         taken under challenging conditions and he did not have much confidence          
                         in their reliability. See later refuted his earlier measurements        See1897e
                         after unsuccessfully searching for the companion while observing from           
                         Mexico and then successfully detecting the companion at a pa of 175 deg         
                         and 4.6" in September 1897 at Lowell. He writes, "The erroneous                 
                         conclusion to which I was led last year seems to have arisen from a             
                         very unusual and entirely unexpected cause, of which we need not                
                         speak here..."  In hindsight, See also reported in that publication,            
                         two observations from April 1895 that he initially did not think were           
                         worthy of announcing. The difficulty in attempting to find Sirius B

                         For the 1904.186 measuremment by T. Lewis, the title of the article,    L__1904 
                         text, and first page of the data table all refer to observations taken          
                         in 1904. Subsequent pages of the data table (including the page that            
                         Sirius is listed on) list an epoch of 1903. However, this is probably a         
                         typo, so date corrected the date to be in 1904.

                         Otto Struve corrected his measurements for systematic errors by         Stt1893a
                         measuring artificial double stars. He provided both the original and            
                         corrected measures of the separation and position angle for the                 
                         companion of Sirius. Aitken cautions that the variance of the angles    A__1935f
                         and distances compared with other observers is often larger for                 
                         Struve's corrected values. However in the case of Struve's measurements

                         of astrometry exists: One from Henry et al. (1997) taken in 1996 (rho   Hen1997 
                         = 2.0" and theta = 220deg), one from Law et al. (2008) taken in 2005    Law2008 
                         (rho = 1.5" and theta = 320deg), and our data point taken in 2012 (rho          
                         = 1.4" and theta = 240deg). Given that background objects can be                
                         firmly excluded, this would imply an enormously fast orbital motion             
                         since the binary would move from 220deg to 320deg and then back to              
                         240deg within 16 years, which is impossible for such a low-mass binary          
                         with a ∼17 au semi-major axis. However, the astometry becomes entirely  .     
                         sensible in an orbital motion framework if we impose a 90deg phase              
                         shift on the Law et al. (2008) position angle such that it is 230deg            
                         instead, giving a continous motion of 20deg in 16 years. In Janson et

                         are clearly identified as background contaminants here, given both the          
                         colors and proper motions. However, the B component gives conflicting           
                         information. On the one hand, its brightness and color are fully                
                         consistent with it being an almost equal-mass companion to the                  
                         primary, which would be a very unusual coincidence for a background             
                         object, especially at a separation of only 1.4". On the other hand,             
                         from an astrometric viewpoint, the B component is fully consistent              
                         with the expectation for a background object. The deviation from the            
                         background expectation is 0.4 sigma, and the B component has moved to           
                         a position that is 7.4 times closer to the background expectation than          
                         its first-epoch position, with confidence for the motion of 7.5 sigma.          
                         This is also unlikely to happen by chance, hence the evidence is                
                         divergent. Since the magnitude of motion is not inconsistent with what          
                         could be expected for orbital motion of a real physical pair, we keep           
                         it as binary in our analysis, but we note that further observations             
                         will be necessary in order to resolve this issue satisfactorily.        Jnn2012

                         2MASS magnitudes suggest the latter is more nearly correct.

                         14) and an estimated semi-major axis of 93mas, also an acceleration             
                         binary. We resolved the Da,Db pair at 0".11, dI=2.6. The minimum mass           
                         of Db derived from its SB orbit is 0.27 Msun, while we estimate the

07312+0210   TOK 393     HIP 36557 = HD 59688. According to observations by D. Latham (2012,             
                         private communication), this is a spectroscopic triple with an inner            
                         period of 70d (double-lined, also detected by GCS, mass ratio 0.7) and          
                         an outer period of 2007d or 5.5yr. The outer system is also detected            
                         by astrometric acceleration (Makarov & Kaplan 2005). We resolve it      Mkr2005 
                         here at 0".057, dI=2.0, dy=2.5 mag, and see the orbital motion. The             
                         estimated mass of Ab is 0.88 Msun. The semi-major axis of the 70-d              
                         inner binary Aa,Ab is 7mas, so accurate measurements of AB can detect

07374-3458   FIN 324     f Pup. It was resolved as 0.2" binary FIN 324AB in 1954.31 by Finsen            
                         (1956) using double-slit interferometer at the 0.7 m Innes refractor.   Fin1956a
                         The components were comparable in brightness with dm from 0.3 to 0.6.           
                         Finsen published 7 mean positions resulting from 25 nights (the last            
                         one in 1960.26). His measures show considerable scatter; the motion             
                         looks erratic rather than regular. Finsen could not resolve AB since            
                         1960.29, despite repeated attempts. However, on 1963.305 he found               
                         another companion C at 0.52" with dm =0.8. In fact W. van den Bos saw   Fin1964a
                         both companions earlier and measured AB and AC simultaneously in                
                         1956.2 and 1959.7 (van den Bos 1957, 1961). AC was measured later by    B__1957b
                         R.H. Wilson, Hipparcos, and various speckle interferometers. All        B__1961a
                         speckle observations show no trace of the subsystem AB, except the one          
                         on 1989.305 where B looks doubtful and much fainter than C (McAlister   McA1990 
                         1990). No trace of B was seen at SOAR in 2008-2011 (4 speckle runs).            
                         AC follows a Keplerian orbit with 81 yr period (Hartkopf et al. 2012)   Hrt2012a
                         which was slightly corrected here using the latest measure. This                
                         excludes confusion between the companions (i.e. B and C being the same          
                         star). Besides, both were measured concurrently by van den Bos.                 
                         The companion B cannot be real. The closest separation of AC is 0.09"           
                         according to the orbit and excludes any sub-system with comparable              
                         separation because such a triple star would be dynamically unstable.            
                         The fact that the orbit of AC is known does not allow us to explain the         
                         apparent non-hierarchical configuration by projection. If B were real,          
                         its orbital period would be on the order of 10 yr (scaling from the             
                         orbit of AC) and it would have shown up in our speckle data. Like 104           
                         Tau, we have here a binary which actually is not binary, but a ghost.   Tok2012b

                         The bright star a Pup (HD 64440, HR 3080) is known as a spectroscopic           
                         binary. However, examination of the RV data reveals that the orbit by           
                         Parsons (1983 ApJS 53, 553) is only approximate. The binary is                  
                         difficult to measure, always close to the diffraction limit and with            
                         dm~3. Instead of the spectroscopic period of 6.99yr, our orbit has              
                         P=7.4y and is still preliminary. More RV coverage is obviously needed.  Tok2015c

                         association (van der Hucht et al. 1997 NewA 2, 245; Schaerer et al.             
                         1997 ApJ 484, L153) at a distance of 258 +41/-31 pc; however, the               
                         Hipparcos distances for the B stars in Vel OB2 (Brandt et al. 1971 ApJ          
                         1623, L99) yield a comparable distance of 317 +/- 42 pc.  This is also          
                         consistent with the distance from the resolution of the binary by

                         led to an incorrect WDS designation for this system of 07185-0550.              
                         It is assumed that Giclas' original value for theta (28deg) was due to          
                         a math error, so it was corrected to 180-28=152deg.

                         position by some 12.8 arcminutes. They were later assigned different

08250-4246   CHR 226     Ba,Bb: This close companion to RST4888 has been observed on three               
                         occasions, but has shown little movement over a 1.6-year period. The            
                         1989 measurements of the Rossiter pair were originally published by             
                         McAlister et al. (1990) and Hartkopf et al. (1993). Following           McA1990 
                         discovery of the close pair in the 1990 data, these 1989 data were      Hrt1993 
                         rereduced, resulting in "preconfirmation" of the new component.         Hrt1996b

                         The new pair was initially given component designations Aa,Ab, but              
                         it was uncertain which component of the Rossiter had been split.                
                         Tokovinin et al. (2015) have determined it was the B component, so the  Tok2015c

                         if we assume that the errors are +/-0.5" and +/-5deg, which should be

08391-5557   HU 1443     A,BC is a triple system. We provide the first very tentative orbit for          
                         the outer binary, but note its large residuals from the recent                  
                         measures of AB. Strictly speaking, the orbit should describe the                
                         motion of the center-of-gravity of BC around A, rather than the

08447-2126   HDS1260     AB + TOK 395: Like WDS 08021-1710, the late-type nearby binary HDS              
                         1260 was discovered by Hipparcos and is expected to move rapidly (HIP           
                         42910, BD-20 2665). It was targeted at SOAR for the first time. To our          
                         surprise, the object turned out to be a resolved triple, with the               
                         secondary being a 0".16 pair of equal stars. Hipparcos failed to                
                         recognize the triple nature of this star. The estimated period of BC            
                         is 15yr. The outer pair AB has closed from 0".8 to 0".5 and moved in            
                         position angle since its discovery. The separations between components          
                         are comparable, so this triple system may be interesting dynamically.   Tok2015c

                         orbit, and one wider component which is reported at a separation of             
                         620 mas in Delfosse et al. (1999). Subsequently, an orbit has been      Del1999a
                         determined for the wider pair (Hartkopf et al. 2012), with a period of  Hrt2012a
                         5.66 years and a 424 mas angular semi-major axis. Using the estimated           
                         orbital elements to predict the location of the wider component in Jan          
                         2012 when the AstraLux image was taken, the predicted separation is             
                         ∼100 mas. This is in excellent agreement with what is seen in the       .

                         CD-25 6962 at 14" separation. However, given the apparently very                
                         different proper motions of the components (e.g. Roser et al. 2010),    XXX2010 
                         we consider such a companionship questionable.                          Jnn2012

                         In this previously known system, 2MASS J10162867-0520320 is a                   
                         spectroscopic binary of two M dwarf components, which is in turn a              
                         visual companion at 3.2" separation from a white dwarf (WD).                    
                         Furthermore, the WD is itself a spectral binary, making the system              
                         quadruple, with a demonstrated physical companionship of all four               
                         components (Vennes et al. 1999 ApJ 523, 386). The 3.2" pairing is               
                         easily distinguished in the AstraLux image, but the spectroscopic               
                         pairs remain unresolved. Because the system must primordially have had          
                         a pre-WD primary much more massive than J10162867-0520320 (given that           
                         the main sequence lifetime of an M0 star is longer than the Hubble              
                         time), we do not count it as an M-star binary for any of our                    
                         statistical purposes. The binary is listed as having confirmed proper           
                         motion in Table 4, this is based on the result in Vennes et al. and             
                         not our comparison with the astrometric point in the literature; since          
                         no error bars are listed for that point and since we only get rather            
                         marginally significant results if we assume reasonable errors of 0.1"           
                         and 1deg, we do not draw any new conclusions on the basis of such a             
                         comparison.                                                             Jnn2012

                         2MASS J10364483+1521394 is a triple in the Ursa Major moving group,             
                         consisting of a low-mass M dwarf orbited by 2 less-massive companions.

                         A,BC. The semimajor axis for BC is 161 +/- 2 AU; combined mass for the          
                         pair is 0.482 +/- 0.145 Msun. If the BC dynamical mass is constrained           
                         to this value, an orbital solution for A,BC yields a semimajor axis of

             WGT   2     One of these three components found by Weigelt is probably B  2256;     Wgt1986a
             DUN  98     however, it is not clear which one due to the lack of a continuous              
                         series of observations and orbital motion.                                      
                         This famous luminous blue variable is not classified as an O star, but          
                         it is almost certainly a massive object. The inner structure of the             
                         ejecta of this star is described by Davidson et al (1997 AJ 113, 335).          
                         A preliminary set of orbital elements is given by Damineli et al.               
                         (1997 NewA 2, 107), who suggest a 5.5-yr orbit with a maximum angular           
                         separation of 0".004.  The central object appeared single in our                
                         observations. The H component (HDE 303308) was also observed and                
                         appeared to be single.                                                  Msn1998a

                         allowed us to resolve both components in the 1983 and 1984 data sets,           
                         although both early measurements of the AB pair are quite weak.

                         (Beuzit et al. 2004). The fact that it looks single in our AstraLux     Beu2004

                         concluded TWA 5 exhibited orbital motion, refuting conjecture that              
                         companion was a background object.                                              
             LWR   2     This system has been identified as a member of the TW Hya association           
                         (Kastner et al. 1997 Science 277, 67) and is known as TWA 5. It                 
                         contains a previously known brown dwarf TWA 5B, first suggested by              
                         Lowrance et al. (1999) and later confirmed by e.g. Brandeker et al.     Lwr1999 
                         (2003). The latter also reported the presence of a close companion      Bnk2003 
                         TWA 5Ab at 54 mas from the primary, independently detected by                   
                         Macintosh et al. (2001). We detect TWA 5B in our AstraLux data, but     MBA2001 
                         not TWA 5Ab, which implies that the projected separation was probably           
                         smaller in 2010 than it was in 2000. The orbit of TWA 5Aa/Ab has been           
                         analyzed in detail by Konopacky et al. (2007). Using the orbital        Kon2007 
                         parameters that they determine, we deduce that at epoch 2010.11, the            
                         projected separation should be only about 18 mas, which is well                 
                         consistent with our non-detection of TWA 5Ab. We use the best-fit               
                         total mass of 0.71Msun for TWA 5Aa/Ab from Konopacky et al.             Jnn2012

12058-6934   GS Mus      Harmanec (1987 Bull. Astron. Inst. Czech. 38, 283) gives a preliminary          
                         orbit with P = 1.74 d and K = 12.4 km/sec.  The same period and its             
                         double also appear in photometry (van Genderen et al. 1989 A&A 213,             
                         161), so the radial velocity variations may be related to pulsation             
                         instead of orbital motion.  The radial velocity variations are also

                         32mas separation corresponds to an orbital period of ~2yr. However,             
                         the separations in the y and I filters are somewhat discordant;

12177-6410   JNN  79     The two targets 2MASS J12173945-6409418 and J12174012-6409389 are               
                         physically bound, as shown by common proper motion analysis. However,           
                         this means that one of the targets likely has an error in the Riaz et           
                         al. (2006) spectral type determination, since J12174012-6409389 is      Ria2006 
                         classified as M2 but is fainter than J12174012-6409389, which is                
                         classified as M3.5. The fact that J12174012-6409389 is fainter holds            
                         true both in 2MASS and in the AstraLux images. Both components are              
                         resolved as close binaries with AstraLux, so we consider it a strong            
                         candidate for a quadruple system, with J12173945-6409418A as the                
                         primary. Concerning which spectral type determination is incorrect, we          
                         consider that it is more likely that J12174012-6409389 is mis-                  
                         classified, as the flux ratio to the close companion is closer to               
                         unity than in the J12174012-6409389 case. We thus set the spectral              
                         type of J12174012-6409389A to M3+/-1, and determine the other spectral          
                         types on the basis of flux ratios. Component Bb is not visible in the           
                         i' data, but becomes visible in z' thanks to the higher Strehl ratio            
                         and intrinsic brightness of the component. A fifth object is visible            
                         in the field, but its color reveals it to be a likely background star.  Jnn2012

                         position angles (mod 180deg). However, the Jonckheere pair is closer,           
                         and all published measures indicated a small magnitude difference.              
                         This pair has been resolved by 2MASS, so added under that designation.

                         common proper motion with the primary at this point. The brightness

                         actually 257.0deg, but since the components are fairly similar in               
                         brightness and there is a fake triplet effect, we assume that there             
                         can be a 180deg phase shift present in the Law et al. data (or                  
                         alternatively in both of our epochs). The angular motion in our two             
                         AstraLux images is 1.8deg in about 0.5 years. If taken at face value,           
                         the Law et al. data point would imply 198.4deg angular motion in 4.5            
                         years, corresponding to 22deg per half-year, which is an order of               
                         magnitude too large. On the other hand, if we subtract 180deg from the          
                         Law et al. position angle to get 77.0deg, then the angular motion is            
                         2.0deg per half-year, which is perfectly consistent with our                    
                         measurements. Hence, we adopt the latter value for our analysis.        Jnn2012

                         If physical, this 0".56 pair would presumably have an extremely long    B__1957a
                         period, given the spectral type and large calculated distance of its            
                         primary.  The small change in theta seen over 2.75 years is consistent          
                         with this, implying a period of order 500 - 600 years.

                         difference, so there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the              
                         orbit is of short-period/high-eccentricity (P~9yr, e~0.6) or long-              
                         period/low-eccentricity (P~18yr, e~0.0). The rms residuals to the               
                         speckle observations are slightly smaller for the long-period orbit,            
                         but mass sums (a^3/P^2) for the two orbits differ by just 2%,

                         1617 he wrote to his friend, Galileo, to observe the pair, "It's one of C__1617 
                         the beautiful things in the sky and I don't believe that in our pursuit         
                         one could desire better." Galileo measured it in early 1617. See the    G__1617 
                         excellent discussion of its discovery in Leos Ondra's July 2004 Sky &           
                         Telescope article, from which Galileo's measure was extracted. It was           
                         independently found double in 1650 by Jean Baptiste Riccioli in         Ric1651 
                         Bologna: "There appears to be one star in the middle of the Great               
                         Bear's tail, where there are actually two, as the telescope reveals."           
                         This was also the first to be observed photographically, by John A.             
                         Whipple with the Harvard 15inch on 27 April 1857. According to Aitken,          
                         this was the first observed photographically (G.P. Bond at Harvard      A__1935f

                         in 1889). A is a spectroscopic binary, P = 20.54d (first orbit 1901).   Vog1901

                         (although it is small, 58mas/y) which, together with photometry,                
                         indicates with high probability that it is a  physical pair AB                  
                         (Tokovinin & Lepine 2012). We targeted the secondary component B and    Tok2015c
                         found it to be a resolved triple. The faint star C, at 0".92 from B,            
                         is itself a close 0".16 pair Ca,Cb.  Note that this is a region of the          
                         sky with very high stellar density, raising suspicion that the Ca,Cb            
                         pair might be a random background object. Re-observation of the triple          
                         in 2015  (to be published) shows, however, that it is physical because          
                         the center of C=(Ca,Cb) moves relative to B with a speed of 11mas/y             
                         (or 3km/s), compatible with the expected orbital motion of BC and much          
                         less than the system's PM of 58mas/y. The estimated period of Ca,Cb is          
                         ~30 years, the period of BC is ~300 years.                              Tok2015c

                         a distance of ~80au. They also resolved the Innes B component into a            
                         70mas pair, which they designate as B and C. However, the C component           
                         designation is already in use for Innes' 30" companion. Also, their B           
                         designation redefines B from the photocenter of the previously                  
                         unresolved close stellar pair to one component of that pair. We have            
                         therefore designated the two stars as Ba and Bb, in keeping with our

                         Binnendijk 1955, AJ 60, 355). The RV of pair B differs by +30 km/s              
                         from that of star A, much more than the visual motion can effect, and

15152+0456   HDS2143     The composite spectrum of this pair is given in the SIMBAD database as          
                         a K0III, and we derive a magnitude difference of approximately 2.5,             
                         which is slightly higher at bluer wavelengths. This suggests that               
                         while the primary is evolved, the secondary is still near the main              
                         sequence, and so a study could be done along the lines of Davidson et   Hor2009b

15462-2804   BU  620     The binary companion B discovered by S.W. Burnham in 1878 moved since   Bu_1879 
                         then by +6deg in angle, now at 0.63" separation. Considering this               
                         slow motion, the pair is likely much wider than it seems, being seen            
                         in projection. The sub-system CHR 50 Aa,Ab was discovered by speckle            
                         interferometry in 1983.42 at 0.20" (McAlister et al. 1987). A total of  Mca1987b
                         four measures are listed, the last one in 2006.19. Curiously, the wide  Msn2009 
                         pair AB was measured with speckle at 4-m telescopes several times (in           
                         1985.50, 1989.31, 1991.39) without resolving the sub-system. We         Mca1990 
                         measured the AB and found no trace of CHR 50 in three runs at SOAR in   Hrt1993 
                         2009-2012. The separation of CHR 50 implies an orbital period of 50     Tok2012b
                         yr. Yet the few speckle resolutions show a fast motion or a random              
                         scatter. If the sub-system CHR 50 were real, we would expect it to              
                         cause some wobble in the motion of AB, but no such signal is seen.      Tok2012b
             CHR  50     The measures show a large scatter and there are many observations of    Tok2010b
                         the wider AB without a measure of this close companion. The nature of           
                         the motion or even the reality of this pair is in question. A "ghost".

16195-3054   BSO  12     AB + TOK 410Ba,Bb: HIP 79980 and HIP 79979 form a 23" CPM pair AB               
                         where the F6III primary is slightly evolved, while the G1/G2 secondary          
                         is closer to the main sequence, but still above it. The Hipparcos               
                         parallax of B, -4.7mas, is obviously wrong, so we assume the parallax           
                         of the primary, 20.7mas. The RV(B) is variable (GCS), and we resolve            
                         it into a 40mas pair with an estimated period on the order of 1yr. The          
                         pair moved by 10deg in a month. Binary motion is the likely cause of            
                         the incorrect Hipparcos parallax.                                       Tok2015c

                         also a member of the system. There is strong evidence that it is an             
                         astrometric binary. The pair is the large proper-motion star Wolf 630           
                         which forms a multiple system with the SB Wolf 629 (mag.11.7, 72",              
                         sdM4) and VBS 8 (mag. about 18, 221"), so  the whole system is probably         
                         a septuple. There is strong evidence that VBS 8 is an astrometric               
                         binary. Eggen suggests that the group is part of a large moving         Egg1965b

                         pair (the secondary is a spectroscopic binary with a 3 day period). In

                         proper motion with GJ 644, making the system a likely quintuple. Since

                         it unlikely that the asymmetry is caused by vibrations). The

                         AB + TOK  53Ba,Bb: This is the triple system HIP 84430. We computed             
                         the first orbit of the secondary subsystem Ba,Bb which was discovered           
                         at SOAR in 2009 and has just completed one full revolution since. Its           
                         separation is always close to the diffraction limit. Adopting a mass            
                         sum of 2.6 Msun for Ba,Bb, the resulting dynamical parallax is                  
                         7.6+/-1.5mas, while the HIP2 parallax is 4.9+/-0.9mas. The latest               
                         orbit of the outer pair A 2592 AB published in Tokovinin et al. (2014)  Tok2014a
                         does not account for the fact that the speckle measurements at SOAR             
                         refer to A,Ba and not to AB. Here we give a more accurate solution              
                         that uses the positions of AB computed from the measures of A,Ba under          
                         the assumption that Ba and Bb have equal masses. After this correction          
                         and orbit adjustment, the weighted residuals are 4.3mas in separation           
                         and 1.3deg in angle. Interestingly, there were a considerable number            
                         of speckle-interferometry measures of this pair obtained in the 1980's          
                         and 1990's at 4-m telescopes, but none of them recognized the                   
                         subsystem Ba,Bb, despite its small dm.                                          
                         Ignoring the multiplicity, the spectroscopic survey of Guillout et al.          
                         (2009 A&A 504, 829) determined a moderate axial rotation V sin i =              
                         10.8km/s and detected the lithium line of 52.8mA equivalent width               
                         which, together with the X-ray detection by ROSAT (RasTyc 1715-0948),           
                         normally indicates youth. These authors do not mention this star in             
                         particular, but discuss a group of active lithium-rich giants in their          
                         sample, to which this system apparently belongs. Even with the larger           
                         dynamical parallax (instead of the HIP2 parallax), all three resolved           
                         components of HIP 84430 are located above the main sequence in the              
                         color-magnitude diagram. This multiple system is peculiar and merits

                         127" separation (common PM, RV, and parallax). The B component = HIP            
                         85326 has a variable RV and an astrometric acceleration which could             
                         hardly be produced by the 1" speckle companion Bb found here, owing to          
                         its long estimated period of ~300yr. It seems that B is triple and the          
                         whole system is quadruple. This companion Bb was not detected in the            
                         previous speckle observations because it is red: dI = 2.4, dy = 4mag;           
                         its color matches a dwarf star at the same distance as the system.

                         The confirmation by Hipparcos may be due to taking as a first solution          
                         the measure by T.J.J. See. It is possible that a grid-step error is     See1896c
                         involved here and an NDAC solution of PA = 275, sep = 0.51", and                
                         dm = 3.2 seems better. However, this would seem to contradict See's     Jaw2006b
                         original estimate of the magnitude of B at 13. It is entirely possible          
                         that See's pair is spurious. Given the small dm and how obvious the             
                         Sco is, this could not possibly be, as has been suggested, HJ 4963.

                         31 Dra. Toyota et al. (2009) monitored the RV of both the A and B               
                         components every 1-2 months between 2003 Mar - 2007 Nov, using a                
                         high-dispersion echelle (precision ~10 m/s). The A component exhibits           
                         a linear trend in RV, with a slope +220 m/s/y. Toyota et al. assert             
                         that these variations are due to an unseen companion. Assuming a                
                         circular orbit, period is estimated at 3200d; minimum mass of the               
                         unseen star ~50 Mjup. Standard deviation of radial velocities for the

                         as physical by its fixed position and its location on the CMD. The              
                         main star is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with P = 6 yr (D.

                         Riddle et al. (2015) to analyze this star. It is resolved here at               
                         0".07. The magnitude difference of Aa,Ab (dK = 2.43) matches the                
                         spectroscopic mass ratio of 0.52 and corresponds to the Ab mass of              
                         0.60 Msun. The orbital motion of Aa,Ab can be followed with AO and

                         more distant companion (per= 99.3 d.) are not coplanar so the orbital           
                         plane of the eclipsing binary shows nodal regression with a period of           
                         68 years. For about one-third of this time, the close binary is                 
                         eclipsing, the rest of the time the inclination is too small for                
                         eclipses to occur. The earliest observations of the system in the year          
                         1899 show eclipses; the eclipses stopped about 1918, started again              
                         about 1963, and stopped again in about 1986. Eclipses should start              
                         occurring once again in the year 2030+/-5. (Otero, 1999 AJ 117, 541L).

                         and B0.5V, in a close orbit with period 1.54d. The Aa component is of           
                         type O9.5V, and is the most luminous star of the system, dominating             
                         its ionizing flux. Aa and Ab are in an orbit with estimated period

                         distance of 1 kpc (Trepl et al. 2012, MNRAS 427, 1014). Moreover, the           
                         SB2 has nearly equal masses, while the resolved pair has dH=3.4,                
                         pointing to quite different masses. The object is also detected in X            
                         rays. Trepl et al. identified a soft X-ray excess and 10sec pulsation

18352+1812   CHR  74     A well-known speckle binary whose first interferometric observations            
                         date from the CHARA speckle program in the mid-1980's, this object              
                         went unobserved from 1996 until the present work. The new data suggest          
                         that nearly half an orbit has been completed since the first speckle            
                         observation. The primary is probably close to an A0V star, and with a           
                         magnitude difference of perhaps 2-2.5, we estimate that the secondary           
                         is an F2V star. This would suggest a mass sum in the range 4-5 Msun,            
                         which is lower than what is implied by the value of P and a we derive,          
                         together with the Hipparcos parallax of 5.04 +/- 0.39 mas. We expect            
                         that the next decade will provide an opportunity to improve upon the            
                         orbit presented here since the separation will be above 0.1 arcsec and          
                         the position angle is expected to cover about 30deg. We encourage               
                         other observers to put this object back on their observing lists for

                         al. (2015), but those authors assumed a quadrant flip of one data               
                         point taken by Horch et al. (2008). That was not an unreasonable        Hor2008 
                         assumption based on the relatively small magnitude difference, but the          
                         points presented here give support to an "alternate" orbit where no             
                         quadrant flips are needed and the period is about half of that derived          
                         in the earlier calculation. Given the revised Hipparcos parallax of             
                         13.55 +/- 0.43 mas, the new orbit gives a mass sum of 3.5 +/- 1.0Msun,          
                         which is somewhat high for a system of composite spectral type F7, but          
                         with substantial uncertainty at this stage. In contrast, the Tokovinin          
                         orbit gives a mass sum of about 1 Msun, which would seem to be too low          
                         by roughly the same amount.                                             Hor2015b

18467-0916   JNN 118     The primary star has two candidate companions in the field of view.             
                         The fainter candidate C is most likely a background star, since its             
                         color is entirely inconsistent with a late M-type star. The brighter            
                         candidate B is more uncertain. It's colors are fully consistent with            
                         the brightness contrast to the primary for a physical companion,                
                         implying a spectral type of M5. It is also visible in 2MASS (Skrutskie          
                         et al. 2006 AJ 131, 1163), which enables to perform a rough CPM test.           
                         The test indicates that B is inconsistent with a static background              
                         object, again implying physical companionship. However, the motion is           
                         also poorly consistent with orbitalmotion, with a sky-projected speed           
                         of order 2 au per year - highly unlikely for such a wide and low-mass           
                         binary. This implies either under-estimated uncertainties in the data,          
                         or an unusual astronomical coincidence. With the small separation and           
                         relatively high brightness difference of the candidate companion, it            
                         is just at the detection limit of 2MASS, and is only reliably                   
                         detectable in K-band. Perhaps there is a systematic noise component             
                         beyond the quoted astrometric 2MASS error in this circumstance. If all          
                         the data are taken at face value, another possible interpretation is            
                         an unfortunate chance alignment with a local M-dwarf, which has a               
                         signficant proper motion of its own. In any case, due to all these              
                         uncertainties, we tentatively treat the pair as a candidate binary              
                         here, but emphasize that more data is needed to test physical

                         an orbital period >1000y.  One close pair is an eclipsing binary with

18550+4822   KOI2754     This system hosts a 0.7 Rearth planet candidate with a 1.3 day period           
                         (Burke et al. 2014). Our ARIES observations revealed a companion 2.11   KOI2014a
                         J mags and 1.65 Ks mags fainter than KOI2754 at a 0".763 separation.            
                         The predicted Kp mag of the companion star is Kp = 15.3 (dKp = 3.0)             
                         if the star is a dwarf and Kp = 15.2 (dKp = 2.9) if the star is a               
                         giant. The companion star was also detected in the WIYN speckle                 
                         imaging acquired with DSSI. The companion is 3.12 mag. fainter than             
                         KOI2754 at 692 nm and 2.56 mags fainter at 880 nm. Assuming that the            
                         planet orbits the target star and that all of the light from the                
                         companion is captured in the Kepler aperture, then the planet radius            
                         should be increased by 3% to account for dilution. KOI2754 does not             
                         exhibit a significant source offset during transit.                     Dre2014

19138+4548   KOI2298     This system contains a 1 Rearth planet candidate with a 16.7 day orbit          
                         (Batalha et al. 2013). NEXSci also reports a 0.8 Rearth false positive  KOI2013a
                         with a 31.8 day period. We detected a companion 1.3 Ks mags fainter             
                         than KOI2298 at a distance of 1".47. The companion is expected to have          
                         Kp = 15.2 (dKp = 1.4), indicating that contamination may lead to a              
                         significant underestimate of the planet radius.  In the simple                  
                         approximation that all light from the companion star is captured in             
                         the Kepler aperture, the radius estimate for the planet should be               
                         increased by 13% to account for the dilution if indeed the planet               
                         orbits the target star and the companion has Kp = 14.9. However, the            
                         companion may be the same object identified ~1" away from KOI2298 in a          
                         HIRES guider image. The estimated brightness contrast from the HIRES            
                         image is three mags, which implies companion is red enough that the             
                         dilution correction might be only a 3% change to the planet radius      Dre2014

                         An astrometric orbit was deduced from Hipparcos data by Jancart et al.  Jnc2005 
                         (2005). The period derived for the visual orbit matches both the                
                         spectroscopic and astrometric solutions within the uncertainty, and             
                         other orbital parametrs are in reasonable agreement with the Tokovinin          
                         solution. The updated Hipparcos parallax (39.98 +/- 0.73 mas),                  
                         combined with the orbit, yields a mass sum of 2.0 +/- 0.3 Msun. The             
                         composite spectral type is K3V; a magnitude difference of 0.8 mags              
                         makes the component spectral types roughly K1V + K4V, which suggests            
                         a mass sum of 1.2-1.5 Msun, accounting for the lower metallicity.       Hor2012b

                         AD: Baranov (1909) measured new companions at (303deg, 29.2", V=7.8)    BnW1909 
                         and (343deg, 160.8", V=9.5), in addition to a measure of the AB pair.           
                         The wide pair was added to the WDS as H 2 26AD, but the 29" pair was            
                         apparently ignored. A check on Aladin shows no hint of either of the            
                         new companions. It appears that Baranov may have accidentally merged            
                         his measure of H 6 26 with measures of the nearby pair 19394+1634 =             
                         H N 84. His 29.2" measure agrees with other measures of that pair, and          
                         a star in the field of H N  84 (V=11.9) matches his wide pair.                  
                         H 6 26AD has therefore been X-coded. Since the identification with              
                         H N 84 is likely but not definite (and since the 12th magnitude star            
                         near H N 84 appears to be a random field star), Baranov's measures              
                         have not been added.  Thanks to Steve Smith and John Nanson for

                         limit is uncertain. There are some unsolved questions, however. Why,            
                         despite the small magnitude difference dy = 1.2 mag, were double lines          
                         not seen? Why, despite the 1-yr period, was the Hipparcos parallax not          
                         strongly affected and the star appears to be on the main sequence?      Tok2015c

19414+4851   KOI2813     This system hosts a 1.2 Rearth planet candidate with a 0.7 day period           
                         (Burke et al. 2014). We detected a companion 1.43 J mags and 1.82 Ks    KOI2014a
                         mags fainter than KOI2813 at a separation of 1".04. The predicted Kp            
                         mag of the companion is Kp = 14.8 (dKp = 1.3). In the simple                    
                         approximation in which all of the light from the companion star is              
                         captured in the Kepler aperture and the companion orbits the target             
                         star, then the estimated planet radius should be increased by 15% to            
                         correct for the extra light in the aperture. KOI2813 does not exhibit           
                         a significant source offset during transit.                             Dre2014 
19415+3903   KOI2904     This system hosts a 1.2 Rearth planet with a 16.4 day period (Burke et  KOI2014a
                         al 2014). We detected a companion 2.74 J mags and 2.58 Ks mags fainter          
                         than KOI2904 at a separation of 0".68. Using the J-Ks to Kp-Ks color-           
                         color conversion from Howell et al. (2012), we predict that the Kp mag  KOI2012a
                         of the companion is Kp = 15.8 (dKp = 3.1) if the star is a dwarf or             
                         Kp = 15.9 (dKp = 3.2) if the star is a giant. KOI 2904 has also been            
                         observed with speckle imaging using DSSI on WIYN and the companion was          
                         detected with mag differences of 2.83 mag at 692 nm and 2.77 mag at             
                         880 nm. The estimated dilution correction for this system is 3%                 
                         assuming that the planet orbits the target star and that all of the             
                         light from the companion is captured in the Kepler aperture. KOI2904

                         CPM of the components suggests that this pair could be physical;                
                         however, since the relative motion of the components is larger than             
                         their proper motion, the question of whether they are physically bound

19468+4231   KOI2879     This system was reported to have a 1.4 Rearth planet with a 0.3 day             
                         period (Burke et al. 2014), but this signal has been found to be a      KOI2014a
                         false positive. Our ARIES observations revealed a companion 0.37 J              
                         mags and 0.27 Ks mags fainter than KOI 2879 at a distance of 0".423.            
                         Using the J-Ks to Kp-Ks color-color conversion from Howell et al.               
                         (2012), we predict that the Kp mag of the companion is Kp = 13.8        KOI2012a
                         (dKp = 1.1) if the star is a dwarf or Kp = 13.9 (dKp = 1.2) if the              
                         star is a giant. If any additional planet candidates are detected               
                         around KOI2879, their radii will need to be increased by roughly 17%            
                         to account for the additional light in the aperture.                    Dre2014

19537+4504   KOI2421     The system hosts a 0.7 Rearth planet candidate with a 2.3 day orbit             
                         (Batalha et al. 2013). We detected two companions 0.42 and 2.62 Ks      KOI2013a
                         mags fainter than KOI 2421 at separations of 1".12 and 4".0,                    
                         respectively. The closer companion is predicted to be Kp = 15.1 (dKp =          
                         0.7), the farther companion Kp = 17.8 (dKp = 3.5). Due to the similar           
                         brightness of the innermost companion and KOI2421, this system will             
                         require a significant dilution correction. If all light from the                
                         innermost companion is captured in the Kepler aperture and the planet           
                         orbits the target star, the planet radius measurement will need to be           
                         increased by 23% to account for dilution. KOI2421 does not exhibit a            
                         large source offset during transit, which lends support to the theory           
                         that the planet candidate orbits the target star, but the system                
                         should be inspected closely to confirm this.                            Dre2014

             LIM   3     Aa,Ab: GJ 779 = 15 Sge. Due to the high proper motion of the primary,           
                         Liu et al. (2002) determine that the faint companion shares common      LiM2002 
                         proper motion. Spectral type of the companion is estimated at L4.5 +/-          
                         1.5; assuming the two components are coeval, the inferred mass of the           
                         companion is 55-78 Mjup.

                         currently unresolved with the Mt. Wilson Hooker telescope, but we               
                         continue to observe this target.  The brighter star of the speckle              
                         pair is also a 311-day, single-lined spectroscopic binary (McKibben et  Bgn1998 
                         al. 1998).  The classifications of the C and D components are from      Hof1991

                         the coordinates nor the measure agreed with that pair, so it has been

                         of OL   80 with a 100deg theta error (expected values are about                 
                         140deg, 3.5"), the near-zero magnitude difference does not agree with           
                         the ~2 magnitude estimates for OL   80. Finally, the coordinates of             
                         OL   80 are 18547-1946, making such a misidentification implausible.

                         A new 2+2 quadruple system. The outer 17" binary HJ 1535 AB has been            
                         known since 1828 (Herschel 1831). If B were a background star, the PM   HJ_1831 
                         of A, 0".208/y, would have moved it by 38" in 185 yr. The pair AB is            
                         therefore undoubtedly physical. The discrepant PM of B reported in              
                         the WDS could be caused by the subsystem Ba,Bb discovered here. The A           
                         component has an astrometric subsystem Aa,Ab with P = 3.9 yr (Goldin            
                         & Makarov 2007), confirmed spectroscopically by D. Latham. The B        Gln2007 
                         component was tentatively resolved by Robo-AO, but was thought to be            
                         too uncertain to publish in Riddle et al. (2015). Now Ba,Bb is          RAO2015 
                         clearly resolved at 0".17. Its estimated period is ~30 yr. The field            
                         is extremely crowded and another faint star E is detected at 12".1              
                         from A by both Robo-AO and PALM-3000. Comparison with 2MASS shows               
                         relative motion opposite to PM(A), so AE is optical.                    Rbr2015d

20406+1539   HDS2947     New observations of this object indicate that the orbit is eccentric,           
                         and that we observed the system near periastron (and below the                  
                         diffraction limit of the DCT). The orbital elements obtained confirm            
                         that picture, yielding a total mass of 3.4 +/- 0.5 Msun. The composite          
                         spectral type is F5 and the system has a magnitude difference of about          
                         1, so that we might suggest that the individual spectral types are F4           
                         and F9. If so, then the total mass would be on the order of 2.5 Msun,           
                         which is about 2 sigma lower than the value implied by the current              
                         orbital elements and the parallax of 13.96 +/- 0.55 mas. However,               
                         because there is only one point near periastron at the moment, the              
                         orbital elements will of course be modified with time.                  Hor2015b

                         ~14.8) was found on two plates taken with the Mt. Wilson 60inch over            
                         an interval of 12 years.                                                        
                         1991.8987: This finally confirms the discovery observation of this              
                         component, made in 1983 (McAlister et al 1987). A number of unresolved  McA1987b
                         observations of this very close system, dating from 1979 to 1981, were          
                         published by Hartkopf & McAlister (1984).                               Hrt1984 
                         A single lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 55 yr yields an    Grf1994a
                         estimated semi-major axis of 1.05", so the companion has only escaped           
                         visual resolution only due to its faintness. MK III measures of the     MkT2003 
                         diameter and no loss of coherence rules out companions with dm < 5.7.           
                         It is possible that CHR 100 is an artifact caused by wave-front         Tok2010b
                         distortions in the dome. The star was likely observed near the zenith           
                         and the separation of the putative companion is close to the first              
                         diffraction ring, as typical for such artifacts.

20577+2624   RAO  24     A new 0".6 binary detected by Robo-AO. It was targeted because of its           
                         variable velocity (Nordstrom et al. 2004) and astrometric               Nrd2004 
                         acceleration (Makarov & Kaplan 2005). The binary is confirmed here,     Mkr2005 
                         helped by the large PM of the primary. Our photometry places B above            
                         the MS. According to Guillout et al. (2009 A&A 504, 829), the target            
                         is young, so its companion could indeed be a PMS star. The object was           
                         already targeted by Metchev & Hillenbrand (2009) in their survey of     Met2009 
                         young stars, but the binary was not detected. After learning of our             
                         discovery, Metchev was able to extract a measurement of the star from           
                         the archival data (S. Metchev 2015, private communication).             Rbr2015d

                         Bradley. Premature orbits have been computed for AB. This is an         Bdy1832A
                         example of a binary known by its common parallax and proper motion              
                         rather than the orbital motion, which has completed approximately               
                         one-sixth of an orbit in the past 200 years. The extremely large                
                         proper motion of this pair has led to some confusion in identification

                         otherwise nearly indeterminate orbit; thus the orbit should not be              
                         used to compute the mass. The RV difference from which the ascending            
                         node is inferred is quite small. Various small variations, formerly             
                         suspected in the period range of about 5-10 years, are absent in the

22017-0925   JNN 135     The two components of the 2MASS J22014336-0925139 system that have              
                         been resolved with AstraLux have very similar brightnesses and colors,          
                         and it is therefore likely that they form a physical binary pair.               
                         Common proper motion has not yet been demonstrated.                     Jnn2012

22019+5506   HJ 1718     AB: HJ 1719 = STI2607. Burnham's note for HJ 1719 quotes Herschel as    Bu_1906 
                         mentioning "a third star 12m from B, 4arcsec; also a fourth." Burnham           
                         also says "The other stars referred to are 12.5m, 268.2deg:                     
                         15.9arcsec; and 12.0m, 145.4deg: 30.9arcsec." These appear to match             
                         the BC, AC, and AE pairs in the HJ 1718 mutiple system. We therefore            
                         conclude that HJ 1719AB and HJ 1718AB are the same pair.

                         This system counts as single in our statistics, even though it appears          
                         to be a triple system in reality. The reason for this is that the A             
                         component was the AstraLux target, and the BC pair at ~7.8" is outside          
                         of the completeness cut-off at 6". Since the BC pair is visible in the          
                         AstraLux images, we can nonetheless analyze it astrometrically. This            
                         pair was first reported by Beuzit et al. (2004) with rho = 0.978" and           
                         theta = 305.8deg. There are no error bars quoted, but if we assume              
                         that the quoted precision in decimal places corresponds to measurement          
                         precision, and adopt errors of 5 mas and 0.5deg, which should be                
                         conservative in that circumstance, we find that common proper motion            
                         can be confirmed at a 76 sigma confidence level. Hence, physical                
                         companionship can be confidently inferred, even if the errors should            
                         be substantially larger than what we have assumed.                      Jnn2012

                         A perturbation of the AB orbit (period ~25y) was first noted by Strand  Str1942 
                         (1942). The mass of the third star was subsequently estimated at 0.22           
                         Msun by Harrington (1968) and 0.4 Msun by Heintz (1984). Based on       Hrr1968 
                         parallax observations, Franz (1958) associated this third star with     Hei1984c
                         the B component, while Heintz favored the A component. Ebersberger &    Fnz1958

                         close Balega pair is Aa,Ab or Ba,Bb. However, Duquennoy (1987) says     Duq1987 
                         the secondary is a 552d SB2 and Horch et al. (2015) have clearly        Hor2015 
                         resolved the fainter star into a close pair and derive an orbit using           
                         the Duquennoy SB elements. The components of the close pair have                
                         therefore been changed to Ba,Bb accordingly.

                         calculated from the speckle data, but a double-lined orbit exists due           
                         to Duquennoy (1987). This orbit has similar elements to the orbit here  Duq1987

23266+4520   GIC 192     The pair HJ 1867 were improperly precessed before, so observers may             
                         have been looking in the wrong patch of sky. Component A of this                
                         optical triple has a very high proper motion. The proper motion of              
                         component B is quite small. The proper motion of component C is                 
                         unknown. At some point during the 20th century, the B and C components          
                         were in approximately the same position, which probably contributed to          
                         the lack of early epoch AC measures. It is possible that some of the            
                         early AB measures may have actually been measures of A,BC. A detailed

23347+3748   YSC 139     Data at hand suggest that this F8 pair with small magnitude difference          
                         is viewed nearly edge-on. The mass implied by the spectral type is              
                         perhaps 2-2.5 Msun, if the system were to have solar metallicity,               
                         again lower than that implied by the orbital elements. The metallicity          
                         of the system is -0.31 according to the Geneva-Copenhagen Catalog               
                         (Nordstrom et al. 2004), which would tend to lower the mass at a given  Nrd2004 
                         spectral type, thus making the discrepancy worse. Nonetheless, given            
                         the large uncertainty in dynamical mass, it is no worse than a 2 sigma          
                         difference at this point. The mass ratio in the Geneva-Copenhagen               
                         catalog is 0.9, so this at least is consistent with the small

                         identification and that the other Guillaume measure goes with           A__1932a
                         STT 508AC. The pair was assigned the designation GUI 39, but nothing            
                         matching his separation and angle can be found in the vicinity of STT           
                         508. The GUI 39 designation has therefore been removed, under the               
                         assumption that Guillaume's measure was of STT 508 but there was some           
                         typographical error in his original reference. This assumption is               
                         supported by the fact that his angle of 19.5 could instead be 195, in           
                         good agreement with contemporaneous measures of the Struve AB pair, as          
                         well as the match of his wider pair with the Struve AC pair.
