The <i>Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars</i> continues the series of compilations of 
visual binary star orbits published by William Finsen, Charles Worley, and Wulff Heintz from the 
1930s to the 1980s.  As of

orbits. All 
orbits have been graded as in earlier catalogs, although the grading scheme was modified as of the 
<a href="orb5/hmw5.html">Fifth Catalog</a> to be more objective.  
Ephemerides are given for all orbits, as are plots including all associated data in the Washington 
Double Star (WDS) database.  A subset of orbits potentially useful for scale calibration is also

<center><a name = "intro"><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></a></center>

The <i>Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars</i> (henceforth <i>Sixth Catalog</i>; Hartkopf 
et al.  2001a) continues the series of compilations of visual binary star orbits previously 
published by Finsen (1934, 1938); Worley (1963); Finsen & Worley (1970); Worley & Heintz (1983, 
henceforth <i>Fourth Catalog</i>); and most recently by Hartkopf, Mason, & Worley (2001b, henceforth 
<i>Fifth Catalog</i>).  
<p>

The 3+ decades since publication of the <i>Fourth Catalog</i> have seen revolutionary 
changes in the field of visual double star work, primarily through the advent and 
maturation of interferometry.  Speckle interferometry, especially on large telescopes, 
can produce astrometric results of very high accuracy (down to milliarcsecond level), even 
for systems much closer and of shorter period than those available to micrometry and other 
visual techniques.  Although the speckle technique has been known since 1970, it did not 
produce data in significant quantity until about 1975; at the time of publication of the 
<i>Fourth Catalog</i> only a handful of orbits had been calculated in which speckle played 
much of a role.  Now, however, speckle interferometry is a mature field, and nearly all 
orbits published since the 1980's have included speckle results, some exclusively.
Long-baseline interferometry [e.g., Mark III (cf., Pan et al. 1990) and the Navy Precision 
Optical Interferometer (NPOI; cf., Hummel et al. 1998)] is now perhaps in a similar degree 
of maturation as was speckle in 1983; an increasing number of binaries once exclusively 
the "property" of spectroscopists are now the targets of multi-aperture telescope arrays.
Indeed, the distinction between the <i>spectroscopic</i> and <i>visual</i> regimes will 
largely disappear in the coming decades, as the magnitude sensitivity of these new 
interferometers improves.  Catalogs such as this will have to evolve as well; as 
spectroscopic + visual "combined solutions" go from being rare to commonplace, the 
argument for publishing only a subset of a binary's elements will grow increasingly 
artificial.  For the present, however, information on combined solutions is relegated to a
notes file.
<br><br><br>

<center><a name = "grading"><h3>GRADING THE ORBITS</h3></a></center>

A major consideration in the production of a new catalog is the determination of grades 
for each orbit.  The <i>Fourth Catalog</i> grading scheme was based on orbital coverage, 
number of observations, and their overall quality, and presented on a numerical scale 
(1=definitive to 5=indeterminate - see Figure 1 for examples) based on the accumulated 
experience of the authors and their qualitative assessment of individual observers.  (It 
should be noted that Worley and Heintz had some six decades' worth of combined experience 
at the time they published the <i>Fourth Catalog</i>; these two gentlemen also rank as the
third and second most prolific binary star observers of all time.)  While useful for 
judging the reliability of a given orbit, this scheme was rather subjective, and therefore 
difficult to duplicate by catalogers having less experience.  For the <i>Fifth Catalog</i> 
we attempted to devise a more objective grading scheme, based on the same information as 
that available to Worley and Heintz.  This same grading scheme is used for the <i>Sixth
Catalog</i> as well.

<center><h3>Evaluating the Observations</h3></center>

In order to determine rms residuals, we first must determine relative weights to be 
assigned to each observation.  The following factors were considered:
<p>

<UL>
<LI>telescope aperture
<LI>binary separation

<LI>magnitude and magnitude difference:  Since we are mainly interested in relative 
    weights to be assigned for observations of a given binary, these factors are presumed 
    constant and we have ignored them.
<LI>"number of nights":  Some observers publish individual measures, while others average 
    2 or more into means.  A simple sqrt(<i>N</i>) term handles this.
<LI>expertise of the observer:  This is the most difficult factor to evaluate.  Accuracy 
    should improve with experience, but may decrease as, for example, a visual observer's 
    eyesight deteriorates with age (some observers produced measurements for 40, 50, and
    even 70 years). We have ignored this age factor for the present, however.
<LI>other factors, such as systematic errors in a given piece of equipment, quality of the 
    scale calibration, seeing conditions at a given site, etc.:  These are ignored as 
    separate factors, but obviously are part of the "observer expertise" factor.  
</UL>

The best method we really have for evaluating the quality of an observation is to see how 
it compares with others.  In practical terms this means we examine the size of the orbit 
residuals it gives.  Here we unfortunately are stuck with a bit of a circular argument:  
in order to assign weights to observations we must compare them to orbits.  Yet in order 
to determine those orbits in the first place we must assign weights to the observations!  
The way in which we chose to minimize this problem was by sheer force of numbers - by 
examining many well-observed binaries whose orbits are generally acknowledged to be of 
high quality.  
<p>

All grade 1 and 2 orbits from the <i>Fourth Catalog</i> were examined, together with all 
more recently published orbits and numerous long-period orbits (such as GRB 34 in Figure 
1).  This last group was included in order to evaluate observers of wider systems.  Many 
of these systems show small orbit residuals over the covered orbit arc, although the 
lack of phase coverage earns them a poor grade.  From ~750 orbits and over 100,000
observations initially examined, some 450 orbits and ~66,000 observations were chosen for 
evaluation of observer weights.  
<p>

Since the number of "degrees of freedom" is large, we simplified the problem in two ways:
<p>

<UL>
<LI>Since binary resolution is a function of telescope aperture, we remove this
    complication by scaling separation to the Rayleigh limit of the telescope used
    (<i>rho_lim</i> ~ <i>L</i>/<i>D</i>, where <i>L</i> is the wavelength and <i>D</i>
    is the telescope diameter.  Assuming <i>L</i> = 550nm, <i>rho_lim</i> = 
    0.136/<i>D</i>, for <i>rho_lim</i> in arcseconds and <i>D</i> in meters).

<LI>Different observing techniques - micrometry, photography (including conventional CCD
    observations), and interferometry (plus adaptive optics, satellite observations, and 
    other high-resolution techniques) - were evaluated separately.  All data for a given 
    technique were first studied, then relative weights for observers using that 
    technique determined.
</UL>

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate some of our initial findings on accuracy versus separation for 
the different techniques.  Both <i>theta</i> and <i>rho</i> residuals show obvious 
dependence on separation.  The long-known fact that separations of very close systems are 
systematically overestimated is also apparent, especially in Figure 2a.  Assuming 
(d<i>rho</i>/<i>rho</i>)^(-2) gives a reasonable estimate of the relative weight of an 
observation, we fit a polynomial to (d<i>rho</i>/<i>rho</i>)^(-2) versus
<i>rho</i>/<i>rho_lim</i> for each technique to determine this first weighting factor as 
a function of separation and telescope aperture.

interferometric, and (right) photographic observing techniques.  The relative accuracies 
of the three techniques are apparent.  
</h4> <br><br>

As a second step, we wish to determine the relative qualities of each observer who uses a 
given technique.  We do this by removing the overall error versus separation fit derived 
above, then determining rms residuals for each observer.  Observers having too few 
measures for individual weighting are averaged together.  Relative weights for each 
observer are then defined as the inverse square of their rms residual (with the weighted 
mean weight for each technique scaled to 1).  We find:  
<p>

<UL>
<LI>Visual observers received a wide range in relative weight, from about 0.1 to 4.5.  It 
    must be noted that this is not really a measure of an observer's competence; a person 
    who only looks at bright, wide, low zenith-distance, small d<i>m</i> pairs will tend 
    to receive a better grade than does someone who pushes his instrument to its limits in
    magnitude, d<i>m</i>, etc.  These more difficult observations are usually the more 
    important, however.
<LI>Photographic observers were of fairly uniform quality.  Observers having significant 
    numbers of measures ranged in relative weight from about 0.5 to 1.4, while the 
    observers making smaller contributions received a weight of 0.3.  Since photographic 
    techniques are presumably somewhat more objective than visual measurement, this 
    finding seems reasonable.
<LI>Eyepiece interferometry tends to get rather low marks (0.01 to 0.3) compared to other 
    interferometric techniques.  Speckle and other single-aperture techniques garnered 
    weights of 0.02 to 1.4, with the larger speckle efforts generally receiving the higher 
    weights.  The Mark III received a comparable weight of about 0.9.  NPOI received a 
    very high weight (13.3), but this is rather misleading, as the number of measures is 
    small and the separation regime of this instrument is such that this is largely an 
    indication of internal consistency.  
</UL>

As mentioned earlier, the third factor is simply the sqrt(<i>N</i>) term which gives 
higher weight to normal points averaged from more than one observation.  Finally, a few 
measures in the WDS are flagged as being uncertain or of poor quality.  The term 
<i>W_quality</i>, usually assigned a value of unity, is reduced by half for such measures.  
The overall weight of a given observation, then, is determined by the product of these 
four terms:
<p>

<center> 
<i>W</i> = <i>W</i>_technique (<i>rho</i>, aperture) *
<i>W</i>_observer * sqrt(<i>N</i>_measures) * <i>W</i>_quality 
</center>
<br><br><br>

<font color = red><b>UPDATE:</b></font> The method for deriving weights of individual measures was 
extensively modified in 2017 September, largely in response to the much greater quantity of 
CCD and interferometric data now available, and the corresponding decrease in the use of 
micrometry. Rather than using only a few technique categories and separate "quality" assessments 
of many individual observers, weights were determined for 18 different techniques, based on the 
technique codes used in the WDS. These technique categories are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>     A
<LI>     C
<LI>     E (mostly E2)
<LI>     Eu
<LI>     H (mostly Hf,Ht,Hw)
<LI>     Hh
<LI>     J 
<LI>     K
<LI>     M (dates 1750-1829)
<LI>     M (dates 1830-1849)
<LI>     M (dates 1850-present)
<LI>     P (mostly Pa)    
<LI>     Po
<LI>     S/I (tel 0.00 -  1.49m)
<LI>     S/I (tel 1.50 -  2.49m)
<LI>     S/I (tel 2.50 - 99.99m)
<LI>     T
<LI>     misc (other techniques)
</UL>

Scale residuals (drho/rho) were determined for 90,000+ measures (based on 493 well-determined 
orbits and 933 linear fits). Relative weights for each technique were then derived by comparing mean 
residuals between, for example, CCD and AO, for all orbit or linear pairs having both types of 
data in common. For this comparison, only measures with separations well above the Rayleigh limit for
a given telescope/filter combination were utilized. 
<p>

Micrometry data were subdivided into various date ranges (since the earliest micrometry measures 
are known to be of significantly lower quality than later measures). After some experimentation, the 
date ranges given in the above list were found to be reasonable subdivisions for the technique. In a 
similar manner, speckle interferometry data were subdivided by telescope aperture, and the three 
aperture ranges given above were found to be appropriate. Subcategories for space-based (code H) 
and wide-field imaging (technique E) were checked, as well.
<p>

Results are as one might expect. Assuming a mean weight for CCD measures of 1.0, post-1850 micrometry
has a comparative weight of about 0.1, with the earliest micrometry measures only 0.01. Large-aperture 
speckle measures have a relative weight of just over 10, and long-baseline interferometry yields a 
relative weight on this scale of about 140.
<p>

As mentioned above, measures obtained at separations near an instrument's Rayleigh limit will
typically be of much lower quality than those obtained at larger separations. In order to
determine relative weight for a given technique as a function of separation, residuals in each 
technique category were converted to weights and sorted by separation (in "rayleighs", as 
described above). Running mean weights were determined, and quadratic or cubic fits made to 
each running mean. These were finally scaled to a maximum weight of one. As expected, these weights 
begin at a value of zero at zero separation, and rise to a value of 1.0 at some 10s of 
"rayleighs" in separation.
<p>

As described earlier, the overall weight of a given observation, then, is determined by the product 
of four terms, now slightly modified to:

<center> 
<i>W</i> = <i>W</i>_technique * <i>W</i>_separation * sqrt(<i>N</i>_measures) * <i>W</i>_quality 
</center>
<br><br>

One additional modification should be noted. Speckle obserations made at separations beyond
the size of the isoplanatic patch will be of degraded quality; W_quality is therefore set to 0.5 for
any speckle measure made at a separation greater than 3 arcseconds.

<br><br><br>

<center><h3>Evaluating the Orbits</h3></center>

Worley & Heintz used the following criteria for each orbit grade (as quoted from the 
<i>Fourth Catalog</i>):  
<p>

<DL>
<DT><b>1 = Definitive</b>.  
<DD>Well-distributed coverage exceeding one revolution; no revisions expected except for 
    minor adjustments.
<DT><b>2 = Good</b>.  
<DD>Most of a revolution, well observed, with sufficient curvature to give considerable 
    confidence in the derived elements.  No major changes in the elements likely.
<DT><b>3 = Reliable</b>.  
<DD>At least half of the orbit defined, but the lesser coverage (in number or 
    distribution) or data consistency leaves the possibility of larger errors than in 
    Grade 2.
<DT><b>4 = Preliminary</b>.  
<DD>Individual elements entitled to little weight,and may be subject to substantial 
    revisions.  The quantity 3 log(<i>a</i>) - 2 log(<i>P</i>) should not be grossly 
    erroneous. This class contains:  orbits with less than half the ellipse defined;
    orbits with weak or inconsistent data; orbits showing deteriorating representations of 
    recent data...
<DT><b>5 = Indeterminate</b>.  
<DD>The elements may not even be approximately correct.  The observed arc is usually too 
    short, with little curvature, and frequently there are large residuals associated with
    the computations.
</DL>

How can these grades be determined in an objective manner?  We evaluated as many of the 
928 orbits in the <i>Fourth Catalog</i> as possible, as follows. We extracted from the WDS 
the ~100,000 observations made of these objects through 1982 (i.e., the same data 
available to Worley and Heintz for their evaluations).  After removing orbits without 
grades, plus a few problematic orbits and obviously erroneous measures, we were left with 
901 orbits and 93,775 observations.  We then determined the following statistical factors
for each system:  
<p>

<UL>
<LI>weighted rms residual in separation (d<i>R</i>)
<LI>weighted rms residual in relative separation (i.e., d<i>R</i>/<i>R</i>)
<LI><i>theta</i> coverage:  measures were sorted in order of <i>theta</i>, then the rms 
    difference in angle [i.e., <i>theta</i>(n) - <i>theta</i>(n-1)] was calculated
<LI>maximum "gap" in <i>theta</i>: also from above <i>theta</i>  sort
<LI>phase coverage:  calculated from period (<i>P</i>) and periastron epoch (<i>T</i>), 
    then sorted and rms differences determined as done with <i>theta</i>
<LI>maximum "gap" in phase (Why analyze both <i>theta</i> and phase coverage?  While 
    both position angle and phase are equivalent for a circular, face-on orbit, position 
    angle coverage becomes increasingly meaningless for inclinations approaching 90 
    degrees, while uniform phase coverage may undersample periastron passage for a
    high-eccentricity orbit.)
<LI>number of revolutions from first to last observation
<LI>total number of observations
</UL>

Some of our results are shown in Figure 4.  Data for each grade are spread over three 
lines in order to more easily see individual points.  Means are listed below the data for 
each grade, with vertical lines indicating mean and 1 <i>sigma</i> values.  "Outliers" 
(removed from the statistics) are plotted in smaller symbols.

Figure 4: Fitting WH4 grades to rms residuals and other factors, as described in the text.
</center></h4>
<br><br>

As is apparent in both the orbit examples in Figure 1 and the Figure 4 results, no one 
factor alone is sufficient for determining the grade.  For example, some poorer orbits 
show very small separation residuals (as evidenced by the turnover in the rms 
d<i>R</i>/<i>R</i> plot for grades 4 and 5); the extremely long period (and resulting 
poor orbit coverage) determines their grade.  Others have shorter periods, thus good 
coverage, but are close and difficult to measure, yielding large separation residuals.  
<p>

Simple polynomial fits were made between each set of means and their corresponding grades, 
and the best fit to the <i>Fourth Catalog</i> grades was found by averaging results for 
the number of observations, the number of revolutions, the maximum angle and phase gaps, 
and the weighted rms separation residual.  New grades were then calculated for each of the 
901 orbits based on all these factors; Figure 5 illustrates the degree of correlation 
between our new, "objective" grades and the <i>Fourth Catalog</i> originals.  Some 98% of 
the grades matched to within one grade level.  A check of those systems where our grades 
disagreed by more than 1 grade found that in nearly all cases the <i>Fourth Catalog</i> 
grades appeared to be in error.  It therefore appears that our quantitative method for 
grading orbits gives a reasonably good match to Worley & Heintz' originals.

determined by Worley & Heintz.  Circle sizes are scaled to the corresponding number of 
orbits with these grades; the numbers themselves are given inside all but the smallest 
circles, where <i>N</i> is only 1 or 2.
</h4> <br><br>

One last adjustment was made before grades were determined for all orbits. Thanks to the 
higher astrometric accuracy achievable by interferometric techniques, we now have the 
ability to determine orbital elements with higher accuracy than previously considered 
possible.  Since an old "grade 1" orbit may no longer be considered <i>definitive</i>, we 
have applied a "grade deflation" factor by modifying our polynomial fits somewhat.  The 
factors we applied are as follows:  
<p>

<center>old grade 1 --> new grade 1.4</center>
<center>old grade 2 --> new grade 2.3</center>
<center>old grade 3 --> new grade 3.2</center>
<center>old grade 4 --> new grade 4.1</center>
<center>old grade 5 --> new grade 5.0</center>
<p>

It is worth noting that combined astrometric/spectroscopic solutions are graded only on the number, 
quality, and distribution of their differential astrometric measures.  These solutions typically 
have <i>P</i>, <i>T</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>w</i> (or at least a subset of these elements) known to 
higher accuracy than is reflected in only the visual data. The quality of a combined solution orbit 
is therefore higher than the grade indicates, although the extent of the improvement depends on the 
quality of the spectroscopic data, the evaluation of which is beyond the scope of this catalog. The 
fact that an orbit is a combined solution is certainly taken into consideration when evaluating 
which orbit of a given pair is considered "best".
<p>

A handful of orbits could not be graded, due to a lack of <i>rho</i> and <i>theta</i> measures in 
the WDS.  The first class of these are the few interferometric binaries observed by the Mark III or 
the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (c.f., Boden et al. 1999) for whom only visibilities were 
published.  These orbits, given a grade of "8" in the catalog, are usually of quite high quality.  
More common are astrometric orbits, which receive a grade of "9"; these orbits tend to give rather 
poor fits to any later resolved measures.  
<p>

A final note:  we do not consider this grading method optimum; a visual inspection of competing 
orbits is still necessary if their grades are within a few tenths of each other.  Other schemes, 
such as the "efficiency" technique of Eichhorn (c.f., Eichhorn & Cole 1985), may be superior and 
worth investigating.  For the present, however, we think this method gives reasonably reliable 
results.  
<p>

(Note: All observer weights were reevaluated in March 2004, and all orbits were regraded and new 
figures generated on a regular basis to reflect measures recently added to the WDS. The reevaulation 
weights led to minor changes for most orbits - typically 0.0 to 0.2 grades - but the inclusion of 
new data has occasionally resulted in major revisions of grades for individual systems, as might be 
expected.)

<center><a name="description"><h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE CATALOG</h3></a></center>

The "master file" for the <i>Sixth Catalog</i> includes all sets of orbital elements in 
the <i>Fourth Catalog</i>, as well as all subsequently published orbits either tabulated 
by Worley or found through searches of the literature from 1980 through the present.  
Several older catalogs, including those of See (1898), Lewis (1906), and Finsen & Worley 
(1970) have been added for historical purposes; others are being incorporated as time 
permits.  This file included 8,406 orbits of 2,656 systems as of 27 July 2017.  All orbits 
are graded, and only those judged of highest grade for each system are included in the
published <i>Sixth Catalog</i>.  If two orbits for a given system are judged to be of 
nearly identical quality, the earlier-published orbit is usually chosen for the catalog 
(unless the later orbit also includes formal errors to the elements).  A few systems are 
found to have two very different sets of orbital elements which yield comparable grades; 
in these cases both orbits are included.  These "special cases" bring the total number of 
orbits in the current <i>Sixth Catalog</i> to 2,739.  
<p>

Names and orbital elements for a given system are tabulated on two lines, with a blank 
line separating each orbit for ease in reading. A text version of the catalog (one line 
per orbit) is also available, as described in the format description page. Columns in the 
main catalog are as follows:  
<p>

Line 1:
<OL>
<LI>Epoch-2000 coordinates, usually given to 0.01s accuracy in right ascension and 0.1" in 
    declination.  Most coordinates were extracted from the Tycho-2 catalog.
<LI>Washington Double Star (WDS) designation.  Many of these coordinates (given to 0.1m 
    and 1') were generated by precessing lower precision B1900 positions to J2000; 
    therefore the WDS designations may vary slightly from the coordinates in column 1.
<LI>Discoverer designation and components involved.  If no components are listed, the 
    orbit is of the AB pair.
<LI>HD (Henry Draper catalog) number.
<LI>Magnitude of the primary component.  Codes ">" and "<" preceding the magnitude
    indicate the value is an upper or lower limit. Codes "v" or "k" following the value 
    indicates a star of variable magnitude or a K-band magnitude.
<LI>The period (<i>P</i>), followed by code indicating units:

<center><a name="calibration"><h3>CALIBRATION SYSTEMS</h3></a></center>

A subset of systems from the <i>Sixth Catalog</i> was prepared in answer to requests for 
lists of binaries which might be used for scale calibration purposes.  Stars initially 
picked for this list included most of the "grade 1" orbits; these are systems having many 
observations (usually covering more than one orbital revolution), good phase coverage, 
and small separation residuals.  These tend to be closer, shorter-period systems, in some 
cases resolvable only by large telescopes or multi-aperture interferometers.  In order to 
provide calibrators for smaller instruments, a similar number of wider, long-period 
systems were chosen as well.  Orbital coverage for these wide systems is incomplete, so 
most were given grades of only 4 or 5; however, since orbital motion is slow, the quoted 
elements should predict the stars' motions quite well for many years into the future.  
<p>

This subset of the <i>Sixth Catalog</i> presently includes 81 orbits of 80 systems.  As in 
the main catalog, figures are included in order to allow the user to visually inspect each 
orbit's quality prior to use.  An expanded set of ephemerides has also been generated, 
giving predicted separations and position angles with finer time resolution than in the 
main catalog (although these ephemerides will obviously still be of little use for very 
short-period systems).  
<p>

Note that all "calibration candidate" orbits are <b>not</b> of the same quality.  Before 
adopting a set of elements it is recommended that users examine the elements, figures, 
etc.  carefully to check whether that orbit appears to be of proper scale and sufficient 
quality for their purposes. Also, using measurements of double stars to calibrate the 
measurement of other double stars is certainly circular (or, if you will, Keplerian).  We
strongly advocate the use of other absolute calibration techniques such as a slit mask 
(cf., McAlister et al.  1987, Hartkopf et al.  1997, Douglass et al.  1997) or at least 
star trails (for east-west orientation) if at all possible.  When double stars are 
necessary for scale calibration, the set provided should be adequate; however, the 
measures determined will only be as accurate as the calibration systems used.  The use of 
these systems for identification of higher-order motions or submotions is discouraged.

<center><a name="stats"><h3>CATALOG STATISTICS</h3></a></center>

Various statistical comparisons of the <i>Sixth Catalog</i> can be made, both with 
earlier orbit catalogs and with itself.  Figures 6 and 7 (below) show the distribution of 
orbits with grade and period for the current catalog, together with the corresponding 
numbers for four earlier catalogs.

<p>

Figure 8 (above) shows a plot of log(<i>P</i>) versus <i>e</i> for the orbits in the 
<i>Sixth Catalog</i>.  The dramatic circularization seen in similar plots for 
spectroscopic binaries is not seen in resolved binaries, due to their longer periods.  
<p>

Finally, Figure 9 (above) is a plot of [Periastron_(outer binary) / Apastron_(inner 
binary)] versus |i_(outer binary) - i_(inner binary)| for the twenty hierarchical 
systems with visual orbits determined for both hierarchies.  Harrington (1992) 
quantified a value of 3 for the ratio of periastron(outer binary) to apastron(inner 
binary) of the inner binary as the critical factor for long-term stability (assuming 
equal mass companions). Hierarchies to the left of the dotted line may demonstrate 
long-term instabilities, while those to the right of the dashed line have ratios that
may allow intermediate hierarchies.  
<p>

Systems which are <i>mildly</i> interacting may show a tendency towards co-planarity, so 
the tendency of smaller inclination differences having smaller period ratios is not 
surprising.  Of the five systems lying between the dotted and dashed lines:  
<p>

<UL>
<LI>02291+6724 = CHR 6Aa + STF 262Aa-B :  Both orbits are of grade 5 and the ratio here 
    is suspect.
<LI>06003-3102 = HU 1399AB + HJ 3823AB-C :  this one is the closest to the line and the 
    incomplete orbital coverage of the wider system may be the culprit.
<LI>08592+4803 = HU 628BC + HJ 2477A-BC :  the orbit for the wider system is highly 
    suspect.  There seems to be a systematic drift in the <i>O-C</i> values for this 
    orbit and it may not be even a physical association.
<LI>23019+4220 = BLA 12Aa + WRH 37Aa-B :  The short-period orbit is based on only five 
    data points (one of those with a large residual) and needs more data.
<LI>23393+4543 = CHR 149Aa + 3A 643Aa-B :  Also suffering from a paucity of data, the 
    short-period system here has four differential measures and needs more data, too.
